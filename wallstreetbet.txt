Not to mention there are rumors that most of Europe will be pushing to move to get off fossil fuels in the next 10 years instead of the next 30 years because of this.Tesla cars and battery packs could be very in demand in Europe.
Joe failed to mention Tesla again tonight, despite mentioning every other electric car maker out there.
Honestly Elon is hit and miss, he has great ideas, starlink and tesla for example, but then he comes up with shit like the boring company, which is just trying to solve traffic by adding more lanes... but underground. But I hate when people hate everything he does, you can dislike the guy without trying to discredit every single thing he does
My tesla calls doubled Friday but forgot and didn't sell, looks like Monday will be a good day
Calls on Tesla
It has historically. Pre war is uncertain. Once war begins markets go up. It did in WWI and it did in WW2. very high returns. Everyone who shorted Tesla in WW2 went broke
Tesla bulls are losing it
And now I hold Tesla bags.  This is fine, I’m actually picking up more long positions at this price.
All that research just to yolo tesla calls?
NIO because I missed the Tesla train beeeeeeeach and sand.
These are common schemes and should be closed.That said, Elon is probably following the Gates strategy to donate to a charity he controlls (gonna leave that typo) so that he can pursue his philanthropy tax free.It's still not fair compared to the middle class. But the Tesla shares are at least worth something tangible, while those art donations are basic scams.
Note:Tesla recalls are almost always a software update pushed to the cars. LOL
News article: "Tesla recalls 578,600 cars due to something being wrong"Public perception: Wow, they have to bring back in 578,600 cars to fix something wrong with the parts or something, thats really badReality: "Tesla recalls 578,600 cars, which really means they are going to send a software update over the internet, so the cars in fact do not have to be physically moved from one location to another, and so no it will not cost tesla tons of money to do so"
“The regulator said about 578,600 cars were potentially involved in the recall, which Tesla plans to solve by remotely updating its software rather than forcing owners to come to service centres.”Really convenience for you to simply ignore this part? Hmmm
First of all, no shit the Iv crushed you when you had 2 days until expiry and still 20% out of the money.Buy calls/puts in the money for 50-70% gains. Stop trying to get 50,000% like those Tesla retards did back in the day.
What a dumb market bro, shittier than expected CPI today, stronger weekly labor numbers, all pointing to much more hawkish Fed coming up and possibly like stated a .50p increase, yet the market takes off again? LOL I swear this is beyond any logic, other than fucking algos and hedgefunds pumping so that we hold the bag when the whole shit hits the fan. Look at TESLA for example... on top of all, they had like 3 recalls in the last 2 weeks and shit, and it takes off again.... Twitter fucked its earnings, was dropped and it's already back at 38 in just 1 hour. What's interesting is that institutions, money makers, etc. are typically the ones trading post/pre market, and they dropped everything early this morning so here we go to buy it all thinking it is a bull run again LOL. They know  how we think by now, so they'll let us into it, and let it run and fuck us in the ass coming down next. This is dumbfuckery at its best.
Elon on Monday: "Tesla probably should be around $30 a share tbh"
Elon's cocksuckers are so ridiculous. I cannot wait until the automakers who sell millions of cars release competitive vehicles, which is imminent. Fuck Elon, fuck Tesla, I'm out
Tesla has revenue so it must be undervalued
[A sea otter holding a scallop has a more stable net worth than tesla option holders these past two weeks.](https://youtu.be/Mho-BpcV9g8?t=4)
Hes shorting tesla
He's saying it's over. Tesla and the market are done. Quitting job? Tesla done. "You'll love the drop" Stock drop.
Is there still a Tesla lawyer approving his tweets? Id love to see the cutting room floor
Yes buy that tesla no need to pay taxes. Fuck the IRS
AMD was in trouble when they were at $2. You made 400%.  If you had purchased at the start of Ryzen when Youtubers started to like AMD again and giving it attention it would have a different kind of bet.  I sold $50,000 (avg cost) of Tesla @ $1650... PRE-SPLIT. Cause Elon was start to scare the shit out of me.    Could have gone the other way around.  My first years stuff like this used to pissed me off and create huge mofo, I just ignore noise now and don't break my strategies and exit plans, even when it means I could have make more, it could also have made less.  Market is a shit storm currently.   Anyway TLDR Don't overthink it and don't chastise yourself for taking profits.
&gtThis sub grew to what it is today fighting rich billionairs who steal from the little guy but why let Tesla do that to their consumers?RIP WSB
I can't believe Tesla release flamethrower, teslaquila, other shit but didn't do an Elon Mask?? in an ongoing pandemic where there's a Mask mandate?
I say this at least once a week. All these new “apes” thinking they know “what this sub is about” when they clearly don’t know shit. We’re degenerate gamblers. We’re retards. We’ve been throwing money at Tesla for YEARS. None of this “buy for the little guy” shit.
Tim AppleElon Tesla
&gtThis sub grew to what it is today fighting rich billionairs who steal from the little guy but why let Tesla do that to their consumers?Before Covid19, this sub was a bunch of somewhat smart but odd doofuses who played options on various companies and often had legitimate DD to back it up.   I'm talking about fairly thoughtful ideas, not just stupid rocketship emoji and bananas.   The place was a lot smaller too.  I remember when we hit 1.7m subs.  It was a pretty big deal and it already felt like it was getting kind of crowded.After Covid19, we got naive and/or brainwashed normies who wanted to 'fight the power' and 'hold the line' against elites mixed with others who saw everything as a potential short squeeze.  Lazy money because it was so easy.  These people pushed out many of the regulars, some who actually knew their stuff and contributed quality DD and reasonable potential plays.So I'm not sure that this sub growing beyond what it was could ever really be considered a positive.  Plus it put this place on the map it was quiet and relatively unknown to most.  I caught the tail end of that, but I still miss it.I'm all for ethical trading.  I don't play TSLA (and a few other major companies) for my own reasons.  But I think most here really simply want to make money, even if long term those plays really harm them or their society.  For most it's entirely about the short term for the self, Not the long term for the community.  This is how most major corporations seem to play it as well.  As a result, I don't think you're going to get much traction here, even if I applaud you for taking a step back and looking at the bigger picture on what and who you are funding.
from what I hear about Tesla reliability, this was a smaller headache in the long run.
You could’ve bought Tesla model S instead.
I had a TSLA Jan 22 $700 Call option, got for a little over $5K on late June.Felt pretty good when I flipped it for $8K…I hit a high of $70k in Oct, goes like $50K right now…I get PTSD every time I see a Tesla on the road. I wonder if this is what Tesla Shorts feel ??
YOLO tesla puts. It's been going up all year it can't go up forever. Trust me OP
If you invested $50k in Tesla when this was filmed you’d be a millionaire by now
Yeah, those rules plus Google/Youtube downvote hiding, Facebook turning into Meta, Boston Dynamic is putting weapons on their robots, Tesla and others have remote shutoff powers over your car and its features, and Amazon's creepy fucking Black Mirroresque commercials advertising a literal spying device. Big Tech is pushing the dystopia button.We fucked boys and girls.
Start by selling your Tesla, Rolex, AP watches, and then learn how to suck dicks.
One thing I know is this. Don't bet against Tesla. Smarter men than me have, and gotten it wrong.
My friend's dad is ridiculously loaded and up until a few years ago drove a Volkswagen Jetta diesel.  He recently upgraded to a Tesla but barely drives it.  Cars don't equal wealth and most wealthy people view cars as depreciating assets and choose to spend their money elsewhere.
A -2% change on the indices means -20% for the ultra speculative no-profit no-revenue racketeering swindling shams we all love to diamond hand thinking it’s the next Tesla.
Nah, that's the part of the movie where our hero finally gets the amount to cover his dept, borrowed from friends and family - and spends it in an attempt to short Tesla
I'm still so bitter. Would be a millionaire on tesla shares if I didn't listen to "smart money" over the last decade.
it's an overcorrection my friend same with Lucid. you have to understand the "smart money" shitted on Tesla for like 8 years before it broke out and now these guys don't want to miss the "next" ride up so they think everyone is the "next tesla". It's funny how mainstream media still shits all over Tesla but when they wanna promote a new company they're the "next tesla"
Man you’d’ve been in great shape if you had held that Tesla like he told you.
Same. I own a Tesla but the F150 looks so fucking cool and once the truck crowd realize what a powerhouse it is I see sales being explosive.
&gt That is textbook fraud.And he paid a fine.This is something else -- JPM changed the price on the warrants a second time after it was clear they weren't going private.  They changed it to a price advantageous to themselves, not their originally agreed upon price.  Tesla paid them the price they agreed to, not the one that JPM pulled out of their ass later.  JPM can go pound sand.
Every tesla lawyer loses one year off their life when musk has his Reddit moments
Tesla model N incoming.
Ding ding ding! I hope this goes to court just so they can get chats and texts from Tesla during discovery, and whatever wildly unprofessional stuff Musk is sending around becomes public record. There has to be some gold in there.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/electrek.co/2020/10/06/tesla-dissolves-pr-department/amp/Who needs a PR departement when you got Musk on twitter?
I agree, seems like the real defense to this was “sorry, I was high” isn’t a great one to use, so he went with “the Saudis would have paid!”But I also think Tesla has a good faith argument against the adjustment handling by JPM, as not clear you can just take the implied vol change for the period and adjust by that But end of the day, you need to actually engage in that conversation, but seems Tesla is just ignoring it
This is a really good breakdown of the dispute: [https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-16/jpmorgan-fights-tesla-over-warrants](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2021-11-16/jpmorgan-fights-tesla-over-warrants) It's behind a paywall for some reason (I highly recommend Matt Levine's email newsletter, which has the same content and is free), but for the time being you can just disable JS to view.
yo elon if ya reading, id really appreciate 1 tesla. I'll even settle for model 3
this is why TSLA has the valuation that it does.  Elon inspires a cult-like following.  You're not investing in Tesla. You're investing in Elon.
90% of that 87k came from flipping Tesla weeklies :D  Great volume, and highly predictable movement.
This is the classic guy that has made “100x” on TSLA but will complain about banks being greedy when the time comes that everyone realizes that Cathie Wood and everyone else that thought “tech” was unlimited when talking about a car company that is valued more than the entire car market of the whole world combined and then some. I don’t wish bad upon you man, I really don’t. I’m just so tired of seeing this and knowing that inevitably they will blame retail consumers (which have a part but are not the major money movers ((makers)) in the market) because people say “hAhA iF yOu WaNt To LoSe MoNeY bEt AgAiNsT tEsLa.” One day this won’t be true and not by a long shot. You may think you’ll get out early but you won’t and you’ll be the same person that complains about “hedge funds” and “banks” when you were just as a part of the greed as they were. I’m posting this because I’m drunk and annoyed with the unbelievable echo chamber that exists here and everywhere else. Retail traders will get murdered when this market crashes and I don’t know when and I’m not Michael Burry so I won’t lie to you. I know it will though and I know all of you people invested in a company that hasn’t sold a car (Rivian) will blame someone else but yourself. This isn’t 2008. You can’t blame AIG, JPM, GS or Lehman Bros. It will be your fault. It won’t be your actual fault, but you’ll give big money a fucking reason to testify in front a congress and say “Look, we just did what everyone else was doing.” The only difference is they do this for a living and will get out and hedge and help themselves much faster than you know how to.The worst part of this is that I want to come to this sub, and many others, and see you people hurt. That’s not who I am and I hate that I feel like that. But here it is, I’ve been saying it forever and everyone here not only ignores it but actually threatens me for saying something different from their opinion. It’s a cautionary tale…I may never be right but I can promise to fucking god there is a reason why big money has participated in all of the shenanigans that exists here. The music will stop and big money will have a chair, retail traders won’t.
Cause it is well known fact that the past performance indicates future performance. Since Tesla went up x20 in the last years, surely it should go another x20 in the next few years too. I mean there is definitely more room to grow for an *auto* company worth of 1.1T with PE of 400.
So, tesla 1500c by jan? Got it
Why are we convinced Rivian is a pump and dump? Wouldn’t Bezos, who owns 20% of the company, want to compete with Musk and Tesla?
Boomer delimma,Get $400,000 worth of tesla calls insted
What are you talking about? Tesla will have it by 2018
I started out with $500, I picked Tesla and Microsoft, got to almost 5k, then I picked calls for snap, sq, pltr, wen, and now baba, I have $4 left in my account.Fuck everything
A few years back when the Roadster was revealed in Nov 2017, I was on the Tesla Investor sub (have shares from back then still) and there was talk about the $50K deposit they were asking for (it was understood Tesla needed cash back then so they pushed the Roadster reveal so early to get deposits). Someone made a similar comment that you should just put the $50K in the stock and not make a down payment. He explained that either Tesla is successful and will eventually produce the Roadster, in which case the stock will be way up so you can then use that money to pay for it OR Tesla will fail and you won't get your Roadster anyways and you will lose your deposit (so the stock declining won't be worse). If you recall back then the financial situation was dicey. In any case, funny to think back about that and how if someone followed that advice, the $50K would be about $1M today and would more than pay for the Roadster (whenever Tesla finally puts it out).
I’ve been watching people say that same thing since the old Yahoo finance message board days when TSLA was sub $100. Quite a few kids college funds have been blown by people shorting Tesla.
i remember my coworker bragging about his new tesla model Y he bought 3 years ago. he dropped $60k on that if i remember. recently i told him half jokingly that he shoulda dropped that money into TSLA stock instead. he just checked the tsla stock price and almost had a heart attack
Let me guess, you’ve been wrong about Tesla consistently for a decade but you definitely know what’s going to happen next?
Just wait, TSLA is going to crash over the next year as Tesla rolls out:- two new factories that will more than double capacity- high scale production of the 4680 cells- fully release (and recognize revenue) of FSD- the 15-20% price increases already published trickle to delivered vehicles that are sold out for 12 months - release the mother fucking CyberTruck- Biden gifts them $8,000 per vehicle - opens global SuperCharging network and becomes the next Exxon
Having flashbacks to Tesla timers 1-5 years ago All of them are broke now
i'm getting the Enron scam vibe with all the EV IPOs.1. we already have the first scam (Nikola Corporation)2. scale up is hard for a newbie car maker. just look at Tesla timeline and how fuck their production until recently3. all talks and no sales with massive hype 4. retail investors seem to forgot that we still have legacy car maker like Toyota. i bet if Toyota went all in and just pump up EV car and sell it for low price. all the newbie EV car makers will die within a year. you can't beat Toyota on production and qualityeven if EV is the future, the market cap is just bullshit even Tesla is overpriced.ride this scam wave and cash out as much as you can. this is not sustainable.
How many "Tesla is overvalued" - posts must a community suffer from
back when tesla was 170 a share a tesla bull has to go through a shitton of mental gymastics to justify its valuenow these new EV companies can just point at tesla and say "our multiples are just sLiGhTlY wOrSe"
Got in at $106.75 got out at $100 like an idiot. Bought $100 puts yesterday for Jan 22 when it was at $169, might not want to do what I do since I only lose money when I invest in anything other than Tesla.
It's a bubble that values solely EV companies like tech companies.VW sold more EVs that anyone else worldwide last year and so clearly have the concept, brand recognition and production capacity and yet are somehow mere fractions of what Tesla, Rivian etc are worth
But Tesla also got that creepy dancing robot coming out that people will program to give them handjobs so... The sky is the limit!
If I were you AND I loved being poor, I would sell tesla.
Ford still getting valued as a legacy automaker whereas rivian is getting valued like a tech stock. Despite both having, ostensibly, the same forward vision.If ford can transition to convincing investors to look at it the same way they do rivian, lucid, canoo, or tesla, then it'll rocket. If not, it'll stay more or less where it is.
Fun fact: That is actually NOT news, it is a cross post from realtesla which links to a Twitter post that was bought and paid for by tslaq. Tslaq has been around for years. It has been funded by groups that have financial interests in harming tesla and stopping the widespread adoption of EVs. Unfortunately they have also pulled in a bunch of useful idiot keyboard warriors along the way. Anyone interested in the topic of this post should look for legitimate and credible sources of information and actually think for yourself before making financial decisions.
Here in Europe Tesla is opening up it’s network for everyone. Tesla or no Tesla.
He could just set up a GoFundMe and the Tesla fan boys would gladly donate to pay off the debt
Bezos, that's why I'm scared of shorting.  Musk *seems* petty.  He gets into a twitter fight with Bernie, calls someone a pedophile.  Yucks it up when he crosses Bezos as Richest Man.   Silly shit, end of the day he's just another autistic ape.  A super-ape, but an ape.Bezos.  Bezos is a real dick.  Bezos mined data from Amazon Marketplace just to fuck small retailers.  Bezos bought a newspaper so he could have a dedicated op-ed page throwing shit at Trump.  Bezos is petty as fuck.  Bezos will fund the fuck out of Rivian, just to ensure there's a Tesla rival.  Bezos will throw mountains of fucking cash at Rivian just on the hopes that it will in some small way fuck with Musk.
Interesting read. I just can't get over the quite franky obsurd valuation of this company.Love the truck, looks well made and full of cool features, but even when compared to Tesla the valuation is absolutely insane. Just can't bring myself to trade on it in either direction.
He’d have to sell like .01% of his shares to pay that lmao But it’s Teslas debt not Elons. And Tesla has billions in cash right now.
Tesla is also only profitable because of federal law requiring auto manufacturers who don't make electric cars to buy credits from those who do.  Between Tesla and SpaceX, the dude's entire business models completely depend on federal regulations and payments, so bitching about tax law is incredibly myopic. He is peak entitlement.
Been around almost as long as Tesla. In that time they've just about managed *a* deal with Amazon. Seems Bezos is just tryna stick his dick in Musk's stirred porridge. In the same time Elon has created a trillion dollar car maker, and beat Amazon to space. Rivian is a fucking pump and dump.
That's something that's doing the rounds now which is a weird one.Everyone thinks he founded Tesla now.
Elon dismantled the Tesla PR department a few years ago...are people still unaware of that?It's great. There is literally no one there to comment on stories involving the company lmao
“Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and has disbanded its US press team.“Bullish
This. He was always a super villain, the memes were just blinding you. Ask the founders of Tesla.
Anyone else feel like Elon is just using Bernie as an excuse to pull out as much cash out of the Tesla stock without freaking too many people out because he knows it's over valued?
He’s the biggest socialist for only billionaires pays no taxes but is government subsidized in every single one of his businesses . It’s absolutely a huge POS move. Fuck Elon I sold my Tesla and his backed cryp bs
I was up 300% and sold at $1,219 when he tweeted about Hertz. Thanks for the gains Elon, but I’m not going to invest in a company that is fucking lying to me about something as big as that “contract”“Tesla Hertz puts”
Tesla is so over valued idk how you can be mad at him selling. You should have been out a long time ago lmao.
Iv bought Tesla calls one time in my life and literally the same day he tweeted “Tesla stock too high IMO” never again will I take that gamble
Elons reputation is fucked until next month when Tesla ATH. out of all the politicians to go after you for Bernie lmao. this dude is losing it.
Lmao Elon is  just trying to unload when tesla is overpriced, and trying to pretend that politicians are asking him to. Literally no one asked him to. Sanders makes a generic post about taxes and Elon is like WAIT WAIT BERNIE YOU WANT ME TO SELL STOCK OK I GUESS YOU'VE TWISTED MY ARM"Fucking clown show, lmao. And if you're actually falling for Elons shitty little community theater here, you're a straight dumbass.
"In addition to a $20 million fine, and the removal of Musk from his post as chairman of Tesla, the SEC’s settlement dictated that any of his public communications that could impact the company’s stock had to be approved."Err... I think that tweet impacted the share price, hello SEC are you there, HELLO anybody home!https://www.theverge.com/platform/amp/2019/3/18/18271914/sec-elon-musk-contempt-twitter-court-fraud
Only if you don't sell right the fuck now. Tesla stocks are coming back to earth and Elon is relying on his army of dream chasers to hold his bags as he cashes out. He wants to make it look like it's the politicians fault for taxing him but it's not. Wealthy people need to be taxed because it's how a democracy should work. I'm worried he will be successful in militarizing his drone army
Like he said, he had options to cash out. By making it seem like he's 'selling his share' he both gets to look good to the Tesla bros and makes money.
Does Tesla still make cars or is it just a bunch of dudes free-basing DMT in a office campus in Texas?
Stupidity runs strong with the tesla fan boys and musk worshippers. He can do no wrong. Used to love Elon but hes more interested in attention than anything.
Yeah it’s time for him to shut his mouth. Rivian promises to have way less drama than Tesla.Musk has been able to get away with this because there hasn’t been competition.
Elon will own more shares of Tesla in 90 days than he did before this sell off.
Yes bitch sell, you think we care? ( buys puts on Tesla)
You forgot to include where Elon said ["I keep forgetting that you're still alive"](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1459891238384115722)This is an easy slam dunk. Tank Tesla and/or shut Elon up for a while with a single tweet. Amazing things like this don't happen though.
Can confirm. Tesla has infinitely more Elon Musks.
disclaimer: i'm a TSLA bullRivian is too high, but they have a production line, in the Mitsubishi factory in IL they bought years ago.Logistics?  Looks like they built a fleet-management system to win Amazon's love and $$$   https://rivian.com/fleetYou didn't mention charging network -- looks like they are building their own too.Truck looks much more fun than the Tesla CyberTruck https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1uYhkMRLWg - hopefully Tesla comes up with more body designs/options as they build out.I'm not shorting, but I might buy if it comes back to earth.
Stay away from it . Totally out of control , investment , it's currently not an investment ...it's a pig pile of people that think it's Tesla . No revs, no cars , no delivery but hey Amazon and Ford partnered so let bring up to 200 bill because why not. Not short, puts ,calls or long .watching from the sidelines and it looks like a mess .
Nah I used to work with a guy who decided to remortgage his house and threw it all on Tesla about two years ago. He didn’t tell me actual specifics but I gathered it was about a half mill or so when the price was about $50. Ballpark about 10k shares. Two years on that’s worth $20MI have no idea if/when he sold or how much, because I don’t work with him anymore. I still work. And he doesn’t. The fucker. Sometimes you just have to take massive risks and gamble your house.
When Tesla dips I want my immediate unrealized tax refund
See now THIS can buy a Tesla. Or 20. Where’s that guy with like 15k gains? He’s need to see this
This guy has Tesla puts!
Homie is just gonna buy his wife 10 shares of Tesla. Eventually that'll buy her a real Tesla.
.. perhaps because the Tesla Model S isn’t new and doesn’t qualify? It won COTY in 2013 so while I like lucid, this is a pretty terrible comparison
He is probably right... not because of "fundamentals" or any garbage like that... but because today was the day I finally jumped on board the tesla train. I not only wouldn't be surprised if the stock plunged 90%. I'm basically expecting it. Buy high sell low right? I'm the best at that
I should have stuck with my Tesla short position longer.
If this was a normal, pre retail investor, pre social media sentiment market I could easily see him being right. Tesla around 150 or whatever would make logical sense when it comes to the fundamentals. The fact is thoough, the retail support, strong sentiment and cult like social media element makes this pretty much impossible imo. Tesla will never fall that much in this era.
Did you say Tesla is making electric tanks?
Not sure what could tank Tesla at this point.
The Gov't should just buy $5000 - Tesla Calls and pump a few trillion into the EV infrastructure market.  Problem solved.  You're Welcome
I'm starting to think Cathie Wood has no clue what she is doing and just got lucky on Tesla.
Congrats and fuck you. These Tesla bulls were feelin too good after the stock didn’t tank yesterday.
"I'm not saying Tesla will do that.I am saying it can"Only bold statements lmao
"Current and former board members including board chair Robyn Denholm, Elon Musk's brother Kimbal Musk, Ira Ehrenpreis and Antonio Gracias have also offloaded hundreds of millions of dollars worth of Tesla shares since Oct. 28."
I love how all of the retards were downvoting me and dancing up and down because I said that the stock would fall.That the stock was only down a couple of percentage points.And even when I said that it would take longer than a day for the impact to be felt, they just continued to dance.Well, party is over retards.Go back to when Cisco fell over 80% and Amazon got toasted back during the internet bubble.I'm not saying Tesla will do that.I am saying it can.
Positions or ban but it’s obviously Tesla calls
we are all going to be rich.  I am going to do some seriously retarded shit.  If GME goes into the millions, I will total a tesla in a tesla lot before it has ever been turned on.
sold off one of my ITM tesla leaps at 200% gain to purchase 4 OTM amd leaps. they are now ITM. it's been a good day.
Him selling 10% of his stake in Tesla equals 2.3% of all tesla shares ($27B), which is almost identical to Tesla's revenue in the last 6 months ($26B).
&gt I just got a call from Elon. He said that he is going to take Tesla private at $420 per share.
\*BLOOMBERG: ELON MUSK ACCIDENTALLY BUYS - NOT SELLS - 35 BILLION IN TESLA STOCK. "SORRY FOR YOUR PUTS, I WAS HIGH AS FUCK" - MUSK.
Short reason: Because Tesla&amp#x200Blong reason: same reason it doubled last time, because tesla
pay early with what you know.Tesla is going to 2k a share.Will likely split around 1400$ first though
I am so confused I am gonna short Tesla on fidelity and buy it on Schwab 🤣🤣🤣🤣
I hate myself for agreeing with you. Will probably enter my first Tesla position sometime tomorrow.
Tesla stock jumps on news of Herz buying 100k vehicles, and Musk:- denies the contract has been singned: stock jumps- talks about opening TITS university: stock jumps- says he will sell 2% to end world hunger: stock jumps- says he will sell 10% to pay taxes: stock _______If I were you, I would go easy on buying puts.This is not a financial advice.
I’m gonna laugh If you all play puts, Elon sells and somehow Tesla stock still moons
Tesla will probably be up 5% on Monday
Tesla always raises capital after the retards fomo I’m on a parabolic move. This time Elon’s discovered a way to say he’s only doing it “cus the people want him to”
I'm feeling it for you. Wish I pulled the trigger but I have tengo'd with Tesla and have gotten my ass handed to me every time. But if I had puts I'd be feeling pretty good. If it doesn't go down on this news. Tesla will have achieved it's final form and nothing will stop it.
With the way tesla moves, it will be 64b.
Tesla puts guy is about to buy the most ironic Tesla ever
Put buyers: we’re going to get paid. Call buyers: we’re going to 0. Reality: Tesla always moons.
"Much is made lately of unrealized gains being a means of tax avoidance, so I propose selling 10% of my Tesla stock."He makes it seem like he is a good man for not doing tax avoidance, but he justs wants to cash in on a massively overpriced stock, lmao
For those unaware, Elon posted a poll asking if he should sell 10% of his Tesla stock and that he will abide by the poll results. That's over $20 billion in shares he might sell because of twitter.     https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1457064697782489088
Probably mad rich after investing in both Amazon and Tesla on inside information he heard from the table next to him
No that was the Tesla $50 strike puts in December guy
Not me.  I hate Lucid.  They're aiming for a high end market that does and will continue to have other high end offerings (think Audi and Porsche), and they're saying "don't buy theirs, buy ours" literally in the face of someone like Porsche.  It's a bad play for a small market space.Sure, Tesla had a sort of premium product, but they were also playing in a market space that had nobody at all.  They were the only thing around in this new space.  So effectively Tesla's success is a visualization of ALL the people remotely interested within that market niche.  They got the whole pie and still nearly went broke and lost everything.  Lucid very much does not have that level of availability of market interest.  Lucid made a really bad choice.Rivian is different in that they focused hard on the two big mainstream market spaces, SUVs and trucks.  They are slightly unlucky with timing since brands like Ford are starting to roll some products into these market spaces, but just a couple years ago, there was no choice in EV for SUVs or trucks.  Rivian is also being relatively normal in styling and construction so they will be easily understood and received.  And they are staying relatively affordable so much of the mainstream actually has the means to own one.  Rivian is pricing their truck right in the middle of Ford's Lightning cost range.  The Rivian SUV might compete somewhat with the Mach-E, and again, pricing is relatively comparable.  They're hitting the right marks to make a big splash.  The only thing Rivian can do wrong is fuck up the business side of it, and so far they're progressing in a way that seems pretty professional.Rivian's doing it right.  Lucid is being stupid.  And Telsa just hit the market space first and has had a lot of years to establish itself.  But, Telsa is now at the peak.  The EV market will continue to get flooded from every automaker, and it's going to eat heavily into their market share.  It's going to become a tight, lean race.
55B valuation, ~200 delivered so far, 50k truck and SUV preorders, 100k amazon delivery van preorders, unique market segments. Gets shit on by WSB. Meanwhile, Lucid passed $60B today with less than 20 delivered, 7500 preorders, over priced #basic Tesla knockoff with a bit better range, and many on WSB are tripping over themselves to buy Lucid lol
Thank you. You're the only one who gave a serious answer.Anyways, now that my Tesla battery is fried, I can declare bankruptcy.
Eh... not really.  This guys strategy isn't terrible.  Thesis is that Tesla is ready for a quick sharp correction that can be capitalized on, but its difficult to predict exactly what.  So instead of dropping all the tendies at once, choose entries up front and set expectations of wht you're willing to lose so you don't freak the fuck out and change up the play halfway through.Tesla has corrected in the past, harshly.  Its rebounded, but this isn't a long play.  It's assuming that even if TSLA continues there's significant room for a 10-20% drop before continuing.  No one is suggesting TSLA is worthless or should be naked shorted.  He's buying puts, which doesn't put anyone at risk of losing money they don't have.Guy's strategy is ballsy with TSLA, but has real potential.  If I had money and balls I'd be tempted to follow along.
You can short a Tesla by connecting the positive terminal to the negative terminal.
Is Tesla overvalued at the moment? Yes.Would I spend a single dime shorting this stock? No.I think that explains this stock‘s dynamic quite well.
Never bet against the Tesla cultists. They won’t sell
You're saying I should short Tesla with my life savings? I'm retard I can't understand
Didn’t Toyota help Tesla at one point
Tesla makes money not cars duh its a money company
They dont' sell batteries.  Holy shit, how has this persisted.They use Panasonic batteries.  Tesla modifies battery packs to ride redlines for performance.They don't make, produce, or sell betteries at all and NEVER will
Your second mistake is thinking that Tesla is a car company.
Potential may be limitless, but potential realization is finished. Tesla is valued more than the total market combined. I vote cult ...
I'll never understand people like that. It's ok to not like a company, but Tesla haters make it their entire world. It's just a sad way to live. (and a poor way to live)
Tesla is like my ex-wife.  I thought I understood it,  I didn't really understand it,  I lost a lot of money because of it,  I don't talk to it anymore.
It’s about 50 people whose whole identity revolves around hating Musk. They are much more focused on SpaceX now that Tesla is profitable.
Doesn't say they bet against Tesla. If they did though then the loss porn is coming
People have been saying this for years bro. I wouldn't bet against Tesla.
Tesla can't keep up with demand. Thats like 90% of the problem. We will see how your statement's hold up end of 2022 when giga Texas and giga Berlin are online.
I own Tesla stock and I honestly don’t know why it is valued this high but I guess I don’t mind lol
What you're failing to understand is that the market is pricing in Tesla's submarine division. In the year 30XXX, the entire globe will be covered in water. Tesla will already have a head start as the country transitions to below sea level transportation. As you know, America is a driving country, so every American will need a submarine.
I have a Tesla but there’s no apps or infrastructure locking me in. If VW had something similar in a year there’s no reason I’d need to keep the Tesla.
Tesla is valued like Elon is an alien from an advanced galaxy spanning civilization who is bringing unbeatable technology to Earth but he's just an alien from South Africa.
The thing is tech is valued so high because it scales easily. If more people use Facebook they get a few more servers and BOOM they’re good to go. If more people want any Tesla product there’s a manufacturing line that needs to be made or built up. That takes a lot of time and money.
idk man. there’s a lot more tech in tesla than in wework
This is why if Tesla did a 1:10 split people would buy it back up to $1000.It's like an infinite money glitch for Tesla.
I get roasted everytime I say this BUT, when SpaceX does something, it does appear that there is a positive influence on Tesla. Tesla also takes technology developed for SpaceX and incorporates it in the automotive technology from time to time.
It's simple really, Tesla is a cult that also sells EVs.I haven't heard a single coherent thesis justifying tsla share price that isn't on some level reliant on the technoking's loyal following.Don't mistake me for a 🌈🐻. I like money way too much to bet against a fanatical hoard with shared delusions.
Tesla shares will be the new world currency after the Dollar implodes
The logical solution is to short Tesla.For this reason, I will be purchasing $10000 calls
I'm bullish on Tesla but the valuation is silly. Here's the thing nobody want to talk about. 1. If we taper then stocks will recoil and these values in tech will collapse at least for a few months. 2. If we don't taper and we just keep going, then we get no reset. No reset means hyper inflation. Hyper inflation means bigger collapse later.This is not a fud post. This is reality. I have no idea when we will reset, but something eventually has to give.
If every dick, Jane, and Larry want to buy Tesla….well…it will keep doing this. 99% of people you meet don’t know or care what market cap is so yeah, this doesn’t need to make sense
&gt Tesla is an American automaker and energy storage company based in Palo Alto, California. The company specializes in electric cars, Lithium-ion battery energy storage and solar panel manufacturing
Tesla? Hmm, never heard of it but I’ll check it out
Tesla could have 100% of the entire car industry on earth and it wouldn't justify their current valuation. 30% of the planet's car industry plus 100% of all energy storage and battery markets wouldn't justify their current valuation, either, and that's even being generous and assuming the energy storage industry grows something like 400% in ten years.
This hurts so much because I owned 178 shares that same year. The NYT article of winter range loss scared me and I sold for a measly 35% gain at $39/share in March 2012...Turns out the "journalist" lied about everything including needing to get the car towed while Tesla tracked everything remotely
Every time someone says Tesla is overvalued, it goes up more out of spite
No shit.  He is running a 3X leveraged Tesla ETF.  Wait a minute!  Sugar Mama Kathie?  Is that you?
BREAKING NEWS: Tesla stock rise sharply on optimism of Tesla stock rising sharply!
I’m actually with you, I’m a huge Tesla bull and truly believe they’ll be worth $3-4tn within the next 4 years.I sold 75% of my holding at $1100 though and for the first time in about 3 years I’m hoping Tesla’s share price corrects so I can buy back in..This feels alien to me. Good luck!
I believe my odds are substantially higher than the outcome of roulette. My strategy is simple, I strongly believe Tesla will have a sharp dip/drop. I don't know when, but it will. My odds of it happening increase on every pump giving the fact the next stock Tesla would overcome is actually Amazon, then Google. This is not a small market cap stock with unlimited upside, it's running out of room in my opinion. Although it is possible for Tesla to temporarily surpass these companies because of how irrational the market is. (True valuation clearly doesn't matter here) the point here is, its current price may be fair for Tesla but in the future. Not now, the bulls got too greedy too soon.  The argument that Tesla is should not be worth more than companies like Amazon and Google is strong, of course, those companies will grow in value as well where things fall back into a reasonable line.  But, it goes back to square one, too high, too fast, too soon. None of the bull's arguments defend Tesla during a harsh red week or month in the market, worse a crash. We all know based on history Tesla would be the first to go.   Don't get me wrong. I strongly believe Tesla deserves a high valuation. I am all for a $1 Trillion even upwards of a $3 trillion market cap, but all with given time. Too fast, too high, too soon. The cult-like following on Tesla is built of money craving impatient newbs, which a good amount of run away at first sight of a change or new hype. Panic, profit takers. During that time, when it comes, id like to have my turn in making a profit. I rather bet on a dip with such high numbers than bet on an even further run. Then again, even if it goes up we go back to square one, I increase my odds averaging up.  This is a shorter-term strategy, not a Perma bear case.
I filled my basket with Tesla shares and shoved the eggs up my ass
Wait till you discover Tesla puts
Tesla is the next Tesla
i mean literally tesla is like you don’t wanna get in because it’s been running so fucking much, then you finally say fuck it and get in and your options immediately tank 70% and you say never again, only to repeat e process 4 months later
Incoming tesla food cannon!
They'll will probably buy Tesla and make it $12 B in a year.
Incoming tesla semi truck!
Sounds like it's time for Tesla to announce that 1,000,000 mile battery...
Wasn't easy. Tesla had some bad years in 2015-2019 and will still have some bad years ahead of it. But I believe now. No concerns except an early pre-2030 death of EM.
Nah fam. Wasn't rich when I started buying Tesla, first purchase was for $34 pre-split.  One simply needs to have conviction. Been buying Tesla since 2013. Went all in 2018 ( via a traditional IRA)
Well he’s made a lot of people on here a shit load of money. Some of them life-changing money. I imagine that’s why they love him. I’d love him and worship him too if I didn’t sell my Tesla stock for a loss years ago and never tried again but at this point I’m just indifferent.
I think it’s pretty hard to make that argument, dude… Jeff Bezos just bought a $500M super yacht… meanwhile, Elon has sold almost all of his worldly possessions (including houses) and now lives in a 400 sqft manufactured house in Boca Chica so he can spend most of his time working on SpaceX. If you’re worth $200B, you’re not worried about making MORE money. There’s essentially nothing you cannot buy at that point. If Elon “only cares about money”, why work his ass off 7 days a week and live relatively modestly instead of spending your days living ultra lavish like Bezos and many others? Not to mention, multiple times since becoming extraordinarily wealthy, Elon has put everything he has on the line and risked going into bankruptcy in order to build SpaceX and Tesla. Most of us would never have the balls to do that. People love him because he’s an innovator and a visionary and he works his ass off. I’m not saying he’s Mother Theresa, but he definitely cares about more than money.
Ah so the secret to making 7 billion from Tesla stock is to already be a billionaire.So inspirational!
For every Autist ape that got lucky with tesla call options gain porn, there is a equal autist ape that sold them the naked call. Noice.
Isn’t Burry short at 750 or something though? 1200 seems a lot more reasonable to me. Tesla is way too high and needs to cool off. Some bad news and a tesla crashing into a mom holding a baby while walking in LA and we are back at 850
Have you never been here before? The entire Tesla retail market is retarded. Betting on it to behave logically is therefore retarded. How retarded do you have to be to not see this?
Tesla is so good even hertz can’t afford them.
Tesla pays its employees? I thought they were all working for free to be entered into a lottery for a 40 acre homestead on Mars.
Hertz uses gains from Tesla FDs to buy 100,000 Teslas
actually tesla would just go up another 10% because they'd have more cars to sell
&gteets of Teslas show that they are the cheapescant wait to see how rental fleet of tesla turn out. customers running out of electricity in the middle of nowhere, etc
Tesla would moon because now they won't have to deliver.
they bought tesla calls before the announcement
Hertz paid everyone in full because it turned out they weren't really bankrupt at all, so it wasnt really a restructuring of debt.   They filed because the market for used cars crashed at the beginning of Covid, so they got margin called on their credit lines (secured by their rental cars).  However, the used car market then spiked to all time highs, so the margin calls went away and they were able to go back to business as usual.  Hertz usually buys around 500,000 cars a year.  They just are moving their purchases from other brands to Tesla.
Tesla in a nutshell.
*throws pocket coins at the Tesla salesman*"Hertz, don't it?!"
Except when Tesla was created, there was no other Tesla. Now with Lucid and all other EV start ups there is a huge $1T gorilla in the room. And congrats to them for actually bringing a product to market. So they'll soon be 'revenue' and stop being 'pre-revenue'.Look, Lucid, Rivian, and Bollinger are all going to sell every car they make. And Ford will sell all their MachE's and Lightnings. But how many is that? What are their bottlenecks and how large are they? Lucid wants to ramp past a low-volume car into the mass market? OK. Do they have 30GWh of cells to do it with? And very VERY importantly, is what is the plan on becoming profitable? How long and how much cash? What's the roadmap?TSLA is what it is not because of the 367k deliveries of 2019 or the 500k of 2020 or the \~850-900k of 2021. They're this way because they have the clearest path to millions and 10's of millions, dominating the global market for the decade.
lol....comparing luxury cars to regular cars.Look at BMW Q2:  [https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup\_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf](https://www.bmwgroup.com/content/dam/grpw/websites/bmwgroup_com/ir/downloads/en/2021/q2/BMW-Group-Halbjahresbericht-2021-EN.pdf)6800 GAAP profits / carAlso, BMW is only valued at 70 B instead of 1250B on a diluted basis.BMW also sell twice as many cars as Tesla
They make 48% of the amount of vehicles as Ford. Ford's market cap is $68B. Tesla is at $1T.Market Cap / Vehicles produced:Tesla- $1M/carFord - $32k/carNone of it makes sense.
Are you sure your math is right? The price in 2013 was $7-$40 depending on the month, counting if you bought at the max in October 2013, for $1000 you get around 25 shares.But Tesla did a 5:1 split last year, making those 125 shares. So around $129k right now.So in case you forgot about the split and you think shares are worth the same, the 38k is actually $190k.Sorry for your loss.
I sware, Tesla probably wouldnt still be a company if it wasnt for the rocket ship emoji.
I bought in on Tesla at 370 something pre split.I just ordered My new House.
I'm fairly certain Mr. Tesla died in 1943
Yeah but Berkshire Hathaway sounds old as fuck, grandpa, tesla is new and trendy. All the cool kids are doing it!
Can't pass comment on my valuation until I've seen an Autism Quotient sample from both companies ... then I will invest according to the factor loadings. Tesla has got to be punching at least a 42+ on that. Goldmine.
Tesla/SpaceX is the real life Weyland-Yutani corporation, change my mind.
Tesla has a bright future. Whereas Berkshire sells underwear and car insurance. Two things that the average WSB ape doesn’t use.
Tesla is a religion at this point.
Tesla will be the whole market soon. Fuck companies. Tesla is everything
Maybe not today, but soon.33B market cap, \~2B annual revenue and \~3B annual expenses, P/S somewhere in Tesla ballpark. Not good for a company that has growth issues.
I might actually buy my first share of Tesla if they announce a split
Yes the revolutionary Tesla, a car company with four models and no confirmed dates for future releases.
I still can't believe there are people who short Tesla...
$1.21 in gross margin for each Tesla share assuming they are base Model 3 and Tesla makes 30%.
Somebody explain to me how they got this money? Did they buy tesla calls prior?
Because their debt is so fucking high. GM has $89B in net debt while Ford is $123B. Almost all of their operating cash flow goes to paying debt.Tesla could pay off their debt tomorrow and this year, the operation cash flow is only a few billion less than GM/Ford.Remove GM and Ford's debt and give them a 50% CAGR for the foreseeable future, their valuation would be sky high too.
Or Tesla being severely overvalued.
Nothing like losing money while tesla players get 4000% gain
How do you have 900K$ to lose on tesla weekly options?
For every Tesla bought, Tesla goes up 1.15M in valuation. Infinite money does seem to have been unlocked
1/3rd of Hertz market cap is the Tesla cars they're buying next year :D
Market cap $1T.Tesla hits $1 trillion market cap after Hertz says it will buy 100,000 electric vehicleshttps://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/25/tesla-shares-up-on-news-hertz-will-purchase-100000-electric-vehicles.html?__source=androidappshare
The best part is that once Tesla started breaking out, Burry tried to save himself by saying it was a tiny short play and the media overplayed it….but he gladly rode the spotlight when Tesla wasn’t moving🤡
Two biggest investing mistakes in my life:  selling my Tesla shares in 2017 because I just didn’t see the value (and thought Elon was a complete moron), and buying CLOV in the first place.
this dude is so clueless he said lambo and not tesla
I lost 200k on Tesla overnight the one time they reported in 2019 and failed expectations by A LOT. Literally any other earnings after that and I would've 4-5x'd my money. At one point I had 800 Tesla presplit shares. Just fuck my life
Nah, Tesla moved me from a modest \~32k to \~540k as of this morning. That 32k was my life savings in the form of Roth and Traditional IRA.
I tried shorting it with puts once. Since then I’ve made that profit back with calls 😂I’ve learned… not necessarily with Tesla but other stocks that it doesn’t really matter what something is worth. It Matters what enough people value it at
Pulled up next to a Lambo last week in my wife’s model x. I pointed forward (can’t rev it). He shook his head and slowed down. Can’t beat the Tesla!
Bitch why would I drive a Lambo when I own a Tesla?
Maybe they were waiting on some Tesla calls to print
Tesla is gonna moon. $1000 before year end
I had my best friend telling me to sell every 10 mins. Fucker held 10k in tesla at 250 all the way to 100k. Fuck him lmao.
Tesla doesn't need to hit the strike for OP to profit, but it needs to drop very fast, very soon. Of course that's assuming he'd take his gains, which is clearly not a possibility considering how retarded this ~~bet~~ donation is.
Am I reading his right? You thought Tesla would dip to 50 dollars by December? Wtf?
50 puts aren’t just betting against Tesla, that’s predicting Elons death and a worldwide ban of electric cars at the same time.
Never bet against Tesla.
I’m not sure “undervalue” and “Tesla” have ever been muttered in the same sentence .
Tesla is $20 away from its all time high how can you possibly be down almost $500 on it
I drive a Tesla so I can tell you why the stock went up. Engineering. This car is engineered to streamline the blowjob process. You get a girl in that passenger seat and play a little caroake. As soon as your Love Shack duet is over and her mouth is agape, throw your arm around her and pull her head in close. She'll understand what to do.
  
  Once you get kicked out of the Wawa parking lot, turn that thing on Autopilot and launch a pop fly into her mouth. The ergonomics are pure blowjob. Tesla to 1000.
I love that I got shit on for investing in Tesla years ago and now all my family is sending me articles about how they are the only car company delivering record sales… end of the day innovation wins. Great video 😂
No kidding. Would love to be able to buy and hold with that much liquidity. Takes guts. Gj OPI think people should realize that $450k turned into $1.9 mil is an enormous feat. I cashed out of my Tesla position when it was $800 pre split. I kick myself for unloading but I thought 100% gain was good enough and especially with all the bear articles coming out left and right. So, for OP to hold and ignore all the noise deserves some serious respect in my book. 🍻👊🏻
Brown lay down, black fight back. Grizzly pray to a higher power as you will meet them soon and it's polite to call first. This bear play dead or lure it away with Tesla puts that expire in 2 days
By most metrics, it's massively overvalued?Its major products are in no way immune to competition, and there's no particular indication that it even has the best models of them?It's most known for vehicles, but has a tiny fraction of the market, and global adoption is  being massively delayed by a lack of infrastructure which - if it is adopted - won't necessarily be primarily used by Tesla.It's a meme stock, however, and that perversely gives it a weird value of its own.So, ultimately, it should crash because meme stocks, generally, aren't a sound way of valuing a market.I'm not long or short but that, presumably, would be why.
It probably is.Do you have a timeframe for a correction or some sort of catalyst for it to drop ?The problem with burrys investment strategy is that you not olny have to make the right prediction, you have to get the timing right as well. Bulls can afford patience to a far greater extent than bears can (except here where bulls leverage themselves into bankruptcy because they bough 0 days a week too early/late)Tesla is posting continuous growth and isnt stopping anytime soon. No it probably wont grow to the extent its valuation would justify but that could take years to become apparent. Tsla stock has a huge cult following as well which makes betting against it dangerous.
There's literally nothing dumber than some retard on WSB with a $5k portfolio mocking Burry.I'm not a fan of Burry by any stretch of the imagination, but he's made more money in the market than any of us.Also I'm pretty sure he shorted Tesla and ARKK in January, so even this play you are all mocking should've paid out pretty well.
Are you guys saying Tesla isn't overvalued...at all? (don't assault me, let's have a serious discussion please)
You guys do realize that once interest rates rise due to continued inflation, Tesla stock is going to get crushed.  Any company with a high P/E will, which is pretty much all of the NASDAQ.
Its a never ending race to the bottom of states giving out incentives. To be fair, a big part of Tesla's initial rise was California's own consumer tax rebate for buying electric cars that made Tesla seem like a more affordable option for many Californians. But now that they have grown to this international brand, they can chase the next incentive. Of course this is mostly a paper move. Probably next to nobody will actually move to Texas.
And considering Tesla is almost like a religion, this one feels even more accurate:https://xkcd.com/1102/
Tesla Sold but doesn't say of they delivered all of them.
Just for a little context, in case someone else needs it: GM sold [more than 2.5 million vehicles in 2020 in the USA alone,](https://www.best-selling-cars.com/usa/2020-full-year-usa-gm-sales-chevrolet-buick-cadillac-gmc/) whereas Tesla sold [less than 500,000 vehicles worldwide.](https://www.best-selling-cars.com/brands/2020-full-year-global-tesla-car-sales-worldwide/)
almost all of her top picks shot up because of COVID. literally blind luck and now shes down YTD because of full retard picks. Tesla is their largest holding and also the only one with gains that aren't directly tied to covid, not surprising that she shills like a retard for them.
They also use entirely different chip sets. I am an engineer for a major motor manufacturer, and [Renesas Fire](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-56486242) seriously fucked up the global chip supply chain. Tesla gets their chips from a different supply chain and was unaffected. This tweet reeks of stupidity, and not even in the good way we are used to.
Also Tesla was always more consistent in their needs so they could keep the place in the order queue.  Where the others didn't want to be stuck with a glut of chips, so they cancelled their place in the queue.   Which in hindsight was a rather bonehead move.
I’d like to see a source that EVs require 3-5x more “chips”. Even then,  not all “chips” are in short supply and it’s possible GM has higher qualification standards than Tesla who is willing to either quickly redesign and skip extensive testing or swap alternative components applying similar lower standards.If you’re in the electronics business right now it’s not hard to find alternatives, but the verification overhead is a real problem.
GM = big company harder to grow. Tesla = small company easy to grow
Well I mean tesla sold 250k vehicles gm sells well north of 6 million vehicles a year...
VW is literally shitting themselves, Tesla makes a model 3 three times faster than VW can make an ID.3 ... THREE TIMES FASTER, Tesla’s been producing cars for a fraction of the time and has been demolishing competitors.
Bought Tesla at the peak today so I feel like the Hamster
This reminds me of WSB-ers downloading the TESLA app and fake ordering cars en masse last year. This might actually not go tits up!
Wait. Your the save guy that made $1m from $500 on tesla calls right?????We have a legend here folks!!!!
This guy probably saw that Cathy Wood “was selling Tesla” and that’s all the DD he needed.
I was gonna say tesla FUCKED him too. But yeah
Lol. Shorting Tesla. Retard belongs here
You bought Tesla puts ? 😂
Looks like Tesla said fuck you too!
Nah fuck u for not knowing not to short tesla , the og short killer
I have a golden ring showing a Tesla logo impaling a bear into the ground. You can imagine where all my money is. My dad thinks I’m nuts but the numbers speak for themselves.
Lucid ran a bull run up to \~$60 as a SPAC. Then GME came out and a lot of big players started reducing their positions in a lot of WSB bull stocks. This thing fell to an average of around $23 for almost the whole year. A lot of haters and bears of this stock said the cars wouldn't be made for years and that this was only a good long term play (around 2023). However this bull run got started because they got their battery certified (and it's better than they thought, longer range than Tesla) and then it was announced that they had secured 10,000 VINs (Vehicle Identification Numbers) which means they are close to production. Thus the run-up. The gamble on this stock is whether this stock will produce cars this year. Bears say no and Bulls say yes. This company has not broken $30 (it got close a couple times) since it's initial bull run as a SPAC when everyone wasn't sure if this company would make a car this year or in the next couple of years. Now that there is a good sign they will I'm guessing that over $30 is possible.Additionally this is a new company with no product so bulls are also betting on this becoming a big company in the future and these are ground floor prices. Bears think that this company will be garbage because Tesla owns the market place. I'm a bull and I think the market is looking for a number 2 in the EV space.
 But I don’t understand. Tesla is the only stock there that could make those 10x gains. The rest didn’t go up as much
Gotta love the confidence of someone who made a million dollars off of a lucky call and now treats a million dollars like play money. In 2020 my buddy made close to a mil playing Tesla options. He of course drank the kool aid and began to believe Tesla would continue to go up forever and ever. This year he lost everything he made last year plus he hasn't paid his taxes from last year yet. So he's down around 450k after being up a mil and refusing to walk.God speed, retard.
I had 100 shares of tesla at $30 that I sold for a down payment.
Seriously. Tesla was a squeeze. GameStop is a squeeze. Clov.... Well, let's just say it's not a squeeze
Reposting here: you’re missing the point of his bet.People don't see the full idea behind Michael Burry's TSLA short. Every single article is about how he tweeted at papa Musk and how he thinks that the company is the worst thing since he dropped his glass eye into his cat's litter box.He doesn't think that Tesla will implode. He doesn't think it's a failing company. He just sees the reality, which is that all of their profits/revenues are way in the future.Let's just say you win a time-delayed lottery and get $1,000,000 in 15 years. Not bad! Now let's say you won the same lottery in Venezuela in 2005. It's not even worth cashing the ticket.It's the same deal with companies. Growth companies, however promising, have most of their expected profits in the future. Those profits have to be discounted by the **interest rate** to be turned into todays dollars. In other words, it doesn't matter how much money Tesla is going to make in the future if interest rates surge today. Well... it does matter... it's just worth a lot less.So how does this relate to the Burry bet? You just have to scroll down a few lines on his 13F filing.Burry has almost as many GOOG/FB calls as he does TSLA puts. Around \~$330MM of them. Why does this matter? These are big tech companies that are actually printing out metric shit-tons of profit today.Interest rates stay the same but big tech goes up? Break even. Big tech goes down? Break even. Interest rates rise? Burry makes more money in a year than all of your wives boyfriends combined.TLDR:The Burry TSLA short isn't a bet against Tesla, it's a bet on interest rates rising (AKA inflation).
Nothing's ever good enough for you r/all losers, ffs. If he got his $50k from putting $3-4k into Tesla five years ago, would that be reasonable? Or would DFV have to have started with $10 for you losers to stop making excuses about why making big money in stocks is unnattainable?
You can also buy stocks in Tesla instead of IOU notes in a random foreign country that may or may not continue to have value in the future.
Well Tesla isn’t headquartered in China… so there’s a big difference right there
The market caps shouldn’t be flipped. wallstreet has made it clear as day they don’t care about the now anymore, they only care about the future and the future potential. all these analyst see tesla future growth as insanely strong.
OP is going to learn *a lot* about theta over the next two weeks.You're not up $15k OP, if Tesla opens flat tomorrow they'll be at $2.10. If Tesla opens red you'll likely be underwater.This is the kind of retardation I come here for 👍
no coincidence Onlyfans starves people of whacking off the same time Tesla unveils a 5’8” 120 lb “robot”
I add Tesla to this list because they are only profitable recently because other manufacturers have to buy EV credits from them to be in compliance. This will end pretty soon.
Yolo it on Tesla 800 weeklies and tell them you forgot what happened
I'll go pick up my Tesla tomorrow if he'll pay for it.
So you're saying Tesla is going to end up drawn and quartered and its remains spread around the world as a warning to EV companies only to inspire more to take its place?
You charge them at night when energy costs are low. Sell that energy back to the grid during peak hours. I think the long term goal for the Megapacks and even the smaller Tesla batteries is to basically sync them all up in their Virtual Power Plant and eventually phase out peaker plants.
Remember - Tesla is just an overvalued car company and their battery tech is nothing special, anyone can do batteries. *Pay no attention the the Chevy Volts that are autoimmolating.*
Incorrect DD leading to fanboy conclusion.  Reality Tesla Deliveries pushed back due to supply chain constraints and inability to source parts. Can’t build or deliver cars if parts don’t show up.
These are the kids who got pushed into lockers and silently simmered in their parents’ basement innovating based on that burning motivation to one day be successful enough to drive up to a gas station in a Tesla and watch as the jock plugs their car into the supercharger!!These days because bullying is frowned upon we lose that nerd motivation. Bullies are essential to long-run innovation. Bring back bullies better!!!
Not if you've bought tesla at 900$
lmfao if they want to turn this into a tesla long squeeze on steroids, be my guest fuckers

Also here to prove you’re not a terrible person if you drink coffee, and you’re not kicked out if you do haha. My reasoning for never drinking it is actually because I just try to stay away from addictive substances, at the bare minimum at least I am saving money by not drinking it so I can invest in more Tesla and lose it there lol
The OG Tesla meme creator is backStrap in boys the bulls are back in town
Tesla is the OG meme srock
Someone selling calls.  Likely a hedge fund that expects tesla stock to not break $1,100
I am married and also lost 150k on tesla, what the wife doesn't know doesn't get you divorced...nice thing is I won't pay taxes on gains for a few years.
Tesla calls? Super cheap? I don’t think you know what the word cheap means, or rather your definition of cheap isn’t relative to this planet.
\- I agree, IMO the answer is:  Tesla is **not** an obvious winner.  In old fashioned terms it has great PR (totally WOW GREAT man) and a charismatic in-the-news boss - a walking meme, and EVERYBODY knows the name. It's the new generation new communication meme-name in the industry, Brainchild of the Amazing Elon. This year's media personality. Definitely BLING. Ask anyone.On the other hand, who knows what Ford is doing now, except DD freaks?   Ford is boring, right?  ask folk in the street "what is Ford doing?" .. &lt&lter uh duh making cars. making ELECTRIC cars, self drive, whatever ??&gt&gt  So the bottom line is  WHAT is so great about Tesla?   Well .. it's LOUD and Colorful and it certainly promotes it's R&ampD like fuck.But the USA has OTHER motor companies. BIG SERIOUS ONES.  Have they all been sitting on their asses doing FA drooling for a year or so being jealous, or are they going for it?
I highly doubt Burry is putting that massive of a position in puts just because he thinks interest rates go up. I'm sure it is part of his thinking on how he can make money but he chose Tesla for a reason. He obviously is betting against the company regardless.
Well said. Dr. Burry's approach to trading has always been to first identify the macroeconomic trend leading the markets and then finding the best thing to go long or short on based on his underlying thesis. Case in point on the Tesla puts.I'd like to add that Facebook and Google aren't just big tech companies with strong balance sheets, but they are also key players in the advertising space, an industry which will benefit from inflation as companies will want to pass their cost basis onto consumers, and in order to successfully do that, they will want to establish their brand image, this spending more on advertising.Also, these being software companies, they tend to have lower Capex so rising material costs will likely affect them less. These factors combined are why I think these companies were among the top picks for his portfolio, alongside his volatility plays.
You’re kinda like burry shorting Tesla except he’s successful. You’re more like bill Hwang.
The NAME, literally the name of the company is there to trap people into thinking they are the next Tesla. This should be the biggest red flag. No legitimate business would shamelessly name their company like that. And to think this pos of a scam had bigger market cap than NIO and Ford at one point.
Its true soon will be nikola tesla ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|trollface)
You can use options in a less retarded way than your average WSB member LEAPS, covered calls, cash-secured puts, etc. Plenty of ways to benefit from options without yoloing 10k on OTM Tesla calls expiring tomorrow
Literally everyone is buying a Tesla with Tesla puts. Bullish.
Don’t forget to show the loss porn just as many others before you have attempted the Tesla short and failed miserably.
I would’ve but im dying with my Tesla shares.
I bought this back in February when Tesla was sitting around 850$. Thought it was easy money. I was up about 10k the following week but it’s been downhill ever since. 😩
Tesla bulls being hit by the Holy trinity of disaster. High inflation massacring growth stocks.Company not making a profit.An autistic CEO.
No problem man. Everyone's been calling Tesla a bubble, but the Dow Jones is the real bubble.
Seems like he timed it pretty well this time. Tesla is down from when he opened the position.
Tesla is more than a car company but not like Amazon is more than a retailer.
Let's see Paul Allen's bet against Tesla
Lean Elon was good for tesla but fat wario Elon is bad.
Lol. Michael Burry has a Tesla put for almost 40% of his fund. Am I reading that right?
Seriously. This guy rage-sells his Tesla shares and does a little write up about nothing, I say inverse whatever he says
Same - always do the opposite of WSB posts. Glad to see that Tesla will rise again.I like that stock aswell
Tesla calls. Got it.
If Tesla tanks this much I'm going all in on futures
\&gt screw that garbage\&gt getting a TeslaEven though you made money you still definitely belong here
Here's the actual way it's going to end:1. A self driving Tesla crashes into a Federal Reserve meeting, killing all the chairs and Janet Yellen.2. In a senior moment, Biden appoints Cathie Woods to be the new Fed chair.3. The Fed announces they'll begin purchasing PLTR equities.4. Redditors become the richest group of people in the world. 5. Backtracking on his promise to never do it again, God sees this and floods humanity a 2nd time.6. SPY undergoes a 37% correction for a couple months, before proceeding to go on the biggest 15 yr bull run in history.
Rubbish. Dow will hit 40k end of the year. Low interest rate, cheap money, low bond yields, post Covid boom, etc these all are fuelling market to rise. Cheap money always end up in stock market. Next two years GDP will be ATH due to sudden pause in economy by Covid &amp then mega QE globally. Lastly, stock market doesn’t trade anymore with fundamentals &amp technicals, the relation has been broken long time ago. When I see tesla a trillion dollar company, Bitcoin 60k, GME 300, I often ask myself what’s the point of having a financial degree, just bet to win or lose!
Told my coworker to buy AMD at $20. She did, and so did I but I sold at $30. She still holding. She thinks I’m a fucken genius because I’ve recommended a bunch of stocks including Tesla pre-run, and others. Sucks to see someone else living your dream 😭
Buy Tesla got it. Thanks for the DD.
So I looked at your profile , you picked Tesla and GME before they took off . I believe in you . Let’s FUCKING GO . I ain’t missing the ship this time .
AMD fan for life . The stock treated me right. I invested back when it was $1.75 and rode that baby for years  all the way up to $90. Sold my shares and got myself a Tesla. AMD 🚀
That would truly haunt me more than it going to zero. Like many times more.It’s like Tesla. I sold my shares at about 400 (pre split) for a tidy profit! :(
That guys lying. I own a Tesla. You have to put your hands on the wheel every 15 seconds. Also the self driving is really bad. It could maybe get you home successfully 1 out of every 5 times. FSD is purely a beta test and you’re intended to take over when you’re about to crash, which happens frequently
A lot of new retail shorts entered the game. Today when the price dropped i saw at least 1000 messages on yahoo finance board. All the shorts where screaming. When price goes up they are silent, but when the price drops couple % they start screaming. We need to learn these guys a lesson. I'm planning to sell 30 Tesla shares and couple Amazon to buy more GME tomorrow. We have a long way to go and i know every investment now is a big profit over couple weeks. I never saw a community like GME. We are like 50 stock communities in one. If we jump the world will shake you will see earthquakes and tsunami everywhere. Thats with how many we are. If we hold together and buy more together nobody will able to stop us. But we need to remove our stop loss limits. Hedge funds are aiming on stop loss limits and when they hit these limits all these shares of the paperhands pussies enters the market. When pussies see this orders they panic and start to sell for lower price. Thats what happend today. I went to the garden to smoke a cigarette when i saw the drop and drink a cup of coffee. Came back was around $180 saw chaos on yahoo finance i laughed made another coffee made a short flight with flight simulator 2020 when i came back it was over 250 again. My mentality is if i die i die like a man. If it goes up nice if it stays here nice and if it goes down i buy more and more every month. First time Robinhood and hedge funds together tried to fuck us and they are warned. We took some scars and are still alive. This time nobody will be able to stop us. Together with hedge funds a lot of little retail shorters will be squeezed. There is no way back we kill or we die. One of us must die.
They going after tesla. No news here. Every single chance they get they have to throw the name out. Even investor pages on IG have generic trading tips and they all use the tesla logo in a negative way. We all know why. To the moon, mars and kepler 22b and all the other keplers!!!!!!
They saw stop loss limits around $300 and shorted a lot of shares in seconds to push the price down and hit the stop loss limits. After that a lot of shares of paperhand pussies with stop loss limits entered the market. Otherwise the short attack had no effect on us. But we are still here and are bouncing back. I will not be surprised if we end the day around $350. This kind of attacks are nothing new and are to bring panic in the market and hit the stop loss limits. I saw couple times attack like this on Tesla. But at the end all these short attacking hedge funds lost billions. If we buy and hold nobody will able to destroy the stock price. They can manipulate it to create a panic for a couple hours, but it will bounce back.
If it were ever 100 dollars again I would buy stupid amounts of TeslaNever bet against Elon Musk
Are you my husband? I just straight up poached the tesla. The glove box is full with all my cosmetics and feminine care, with a pin so he can't reclaim it.
Im going to use my gains from buying puts on TSLA to buy a Tesla
When I saw that green shrek dildo on GME after tesla got hammered 8% I had an instant wave of relief
I can afford Tesla... Model S AND shares
The year is 2025. The Market is literally tits up. The Bull Run of ‘20-‘24 was so epic that all of WSB is now rich. President Wood is about to make her State of the Union address and is expected to announce that stocks will no longer be able to go down, ever. The color red has been removed from elementary school teachings. You kiss your wife before leaving for work in your new Tesla model BB (powered by Ivy). You wife’s boyfriend was promoted to manager at your local Wendy’s and gives you free trendies whenever you stop by. You quit your job and are now a top executive at GameStop. Life is good.
If it hits 100k a share, I’ll let you buy me a Tesla AND fuck your wife with her boyfriend watching
I’ve got a Tesla that I paid the loan off with wsb money. Half of me wants to flex on my neighbor cause he’s kind of a dick and an investment manager at a bank or some bs. The other half knows that’d be kinda cringey if I told him I’m basically making my living off yoloing otm calls from autistic wsb DD. Anyway fuck that dude cursing out his kids 24/7 and getting his fuckin car repossessed and shit lmao
Pretty impressive foresight to do that 20 years ago. Especially since Tesla was founded 17 years ago and IPO'd 10 years ago.
Followed a guy on Reddit named sir jack a lot and made a million dollars. -someone explaining their new tesla to the neighbor
Tesla is on “look how they massacred my boy” meme
They weren’t  sure how we feel abt tesla hahaha
Where the fuck is Tesla
Hahahah imagine this thing hitting 700k in 1 month. Im afraid i would paper hands far before 700k, but maybe ill hold onto my last share forever. But you have my word, if 700k comes i will sell my last share and order you any tesla you want
Man, I only have 4.4 bloody shares in Australia, need to hit 100k for a tesla 💎🙌
If this hits 700k and i actually hold my 100 shares till then ill buy you a tesla
I admit to buy a Tesla when the price hits 1500$ per share
This might be the only thing about him or Tesla or any of this shit that makes sense.
nobody cares no more about TESLA, APPLE, MICROSOFT, AMAZON, PLUG, NIO etc....but GME and AMC ...look at the volumes....so without buying restrictions should be just one way....UP
THE ONLY THING MELVIN COVERED WAS THE PRICE OF MY NEW FUCKING TESLA
My brain is like a freshly waxed Tesla. Too smooth to get the joke
wasnt Tesla the original meme stock? Jimmy Chill was shytting on Tesla for the past 5 years. Now, he is recommending it. What a fucking Douche
I lost $3k on a Tesla call last year, which was the first and last option I ever played. Thought it was supposed to be a double your money button ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
Soon you can laugh at them while they clean your tesla
I sold right around $800 before the dip, won't be rebuying as I used the trendies to get a model 3. Currently at Tesla waiting for pick up.
Elon gonna tie Tesla stock to a space X falcon heavy rocket and launch that puppy straight past the moon and into the face of Mars 🚀🚀🚀
Buy Tesla. Duh.Or Palantir.Or ARKK.Only concern, stocks can do that sideways thing for 10-20 years... So keep on investing as even in a pretty flat market that will make you profits. Then one day the market will take off again.
Rip that guy who posted he shorted tesla
Her price target is like 8k/share per a recent interview. She is assuming Tesla will start an autonomous ride hailing service
Said he was taking tesla private at 420 a share, funding secured. Back when the share price was below that can't Remeber what it was trading for at the time. But it definitely skyrocketed after that tweet.
Cathie has said she has just bought more Tesla stock.. she really is a wsb member lol
Lost over ten thousand this morning on that blank check company whose name has something in common with Winston Churchill. So of course I ran crying to Daddy Elon and bought some Tesla weeklies. Boom. Pretty much instantly made my money back and then some. Daddy is always there for me, even when I cheat on him and invest in other companies. He patiently waits for his prodigal son to return to the fold and then fattens him back up.
Some context:&gt Tesla CEO Elon Musk quipped back at The Washington Post’s request for comment regarding an article about his future with the company, telling a reporter to give his “regards to your puppet master.”&gt The Post’s piece wondered if Tesla can “run on Autopilot” and declared that “Musk moved to Texas and embraced celebrity.” The article elaborated on “critics” who have concerns that Musk’s schedule and public personality “are beginning to show in the car company he runs.”&gt The company in question, Tesla, didn’t respond to The Post’s request for comment, the article notes. Musk, however, did – with just one sentence presumably aimed at The Post’s owner, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.&gt “Give my regards to your puppet master,” Musk responded after a request for comment from the newspaper.&gt     “Tesla did not respond to repeated requests for comment. In response to emails seeking comment, Musk replied only: “Give my regards to your puppet master.”&gt     — Josh Dawsey (@jdawsey1) February 23, 2021&gt Bezos owns The Post, as noted in the article, and is mentioned as one of the examples of the potential for giant companies to stumble amid change. The Post noted that Apple CEO Steve Jobs’ 2011 death “prompted what some view as a loss of innovation at the tech giant.”&gt “Amazon will soon face the transition of founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos to executive chairman, testing the culture he’s instilled. (Bezos owns The Washington Post),” the article added before pointing out some of Musk’s political comments throughout the global pandemic.&gt “He knows whatever he says, people do and he’s taking advantage of it,” one anonymous employee reportedly said of Musk, according to The Post.&gt The worker reportedly recalled telling a co-worker that Musk “doesn’t care about you” and will “ruin you,” the piece also noted.https://dailycaller.com/2021/02/23/elon-musk-flames-the-washington-post-tesla-puppet-master/
70k in 3DTE OTM Tesla calls... didn't think I'd be unzipping this early
This isn’t suppose to happen. I am well diversified into Tesla, PLTR, ark etfs, and weed stocks.
Seriously. If it's not a lambo, it needs to be a Tesla. And Teslas should arguably come first.
Wow didn't buy a Tesla to show Papa musk some appreciation 🤦🏻‍♂️
Agreed.  All the other answers seemed very scripted.  Because they’re the ones that have done some lawsuit worthy shit.  If I was the real Papa Elon Musk, I’d give him a free Tesla.
OP here.This came from an array of trades. Never bear or bull. Aways trying to time a pull back or a rip up with weekly options. All positions are from a lot of different shit. Amd, Tesla fb aapl FedEx ups, whatever you heard of, I traded it. Was on the right side a lot of the time, never with the right capital. Every time I sized up, I was on the wrong side.Entirely gambling weeklies. This is for all the newbies who think it’s a “get rich quick scheme” from seeing the recent gain porn. Those people are literally 5-10 people of 9 million of us.Not saying don’t trade options, just be careful.Also, I’m a full on degenerate bastard. I bet 20-30-40k on combat sports at a time. Play with shit you can lose, please. I hate to see post with“Lost my life savings and don’t know what to do”Started a new account for 2021, will update you fellas in 6 months.GOOOOOD LUCK.
Buying tesla now. Wish me luck guys
Its funny because a lot of people did exactly that when Tesla became a meme stock.  People bet against it and lost a ton of money.  But WSB was like "daddy Elon" and "more calls!" and they kept winning.  Personally I pick a random stock that sounds decent, then google that stock name + reddit and read what people say about it.  If they say "this stock is going to moon soon" I avoid it.  But if people are like "Id stay away from this one", I usually buy 100 shares and end up making a decent profit. I've also tried the monkey strat and just threw money at random stocks.  About 80% of them made me some good money.  I bought Genius Brands at random one time, just purchased 100 stocks before anyone was talking about it at about 30 cents a share, and then sold when it hit $12.  By the time I sold, everyone on reddit was talking about how it was going to keep going up and up, but look at it now. So its a solid strategy to just do the opposite of whatever reddit says, most of the time.
I’ve been trading since 2015. I’ve seen Amazon &lt500$, Netflix &lt100$, Tesla at &lt180$. I will hold my gme shares for sure! When I have learned on thing it is that patience pays off. Just relax and let it grow, don’t worry about short term up and downs. I once was in amd and that was a crazy ride. If I would have just held it it would have paid off big time. Lesson learned. Just hold, be calm, emotions will go high and low, let them pass by like clouds in the sky. That’s the way you’ll make big tendies in this game. Did you see how everyone got excited today at the rocket fuel phase? Guess what our goal is way higher than that and it will naturally climb up higher again. We don’t need hype. This thing will be driven by the share buy backs alone. It will be beautiful
78% is a big deal everyone! Tesla and other companies squoze at far less. There’s blood in the water and it’s time to get this party started again.
I hope he puts it on his Tesla he’s buying with his tendies
Buy one share everyday. #everysharecountsHold the line brotherz and sisterz I want a Tesla model S for each share of GME : $69,420 🤪💪💪💪🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🙌🙌

DONT BELIEVE THESE BOTS THAT ARE TRYING TO CONVINCE YOU THAT GAMESTOP DOES NOT WORTH $100+ ACCORDING TO FUNDAMENTALSThese guys are usually the ones who makes a $1000 investment and does a 8% return in 10 years lmaoThese guys are fucking horrible.If we are watching only the fundamentals(according to their logic) then please tell Tesla to come down around $100. Nothing against Tesla, i love them and i love Elon, but they do not make any profit and every other car anufacturer literally makes more car than them.The reason why the price is around $900 is because the fact that stockholders believe in Tesla's huge potential. But that is not fundamentals, that is specualtion.Thats why, if the Gamestop stockholders believe in the future of GME, it can skyrocket to the goddamn outer rim with all this attention to the stock.So do not fucking sell just because some BOOMER dude telling you with his laughable 8% return in 10 years that you should sell because gme fundamentals sucks right now.And yes maybe the squeeze already happened, but the thing is, tesla skyrocketed without any short squeeze. They skyrocketed because of the stockholders and the fanboys.HOLD THE FUCKING STOCK DUMBHEADS!!!!!PLUS INFORMATION:THEY HIRED A MOTHERFUCKING AMAZON AWS LEADER, AND SEVERAL OTHER ECOMMERCE SPECIALISTS WITH HUGE EXPERIENCE, THEY ARE GOING BALLS DEEP INTO ECOMMERCE, THIS IS FUCKING HUUUUGEEEEEEEE!!Tesla fanboys 3..2..1
Dumping the majority into Tesla. Donating the rest.
This is a wise comment. I was in at 15 and started trimming position at $250 up to $350, and sadly down to $100 yesterday. Had I been in possession of a crystal ball, I could have made out with $70k. Real gain closer to $30k, and I’m still holding 25 shares. That euphoria, IMO, is just as dangerous, if not more so, than the dread of a GUH day. You stop doing anything for your job, you’re glued to a screen dreaming of your riches and new life. And you never think of an exit. I happened to me with spy puts in March, happened to me with Tesla every which way, and I was fortunate enough to be just a little prudent with my gme play. Hedging is ok. Taking profits is ok. It’s what you need to survive and not get wiped out. There’s always another trade.
#OG TESLA INVESTORS BE LIKE BUCKLE UP WEVE TREADED THESE WATERS BEFORE 😈😈😈 INCLUDING ME!!! LETS SHOW EM HOW GME AND TSLA GANG REALLY BANG!!! NEVER FOLD APES MOMMA APE AINT RAISE NO PAPERHANDED BITCH!!!!!🦍💎📈🍌👾
Those of us who have bought in have to remember why we bought in: we believed that GME was worth more than the share price.  DFV had this conviction and so he bought and held.  Daddy Cohen brought the value play up even further.  He believed so heavily in the company that he bought 12.9% and brought 2 ex-Chewy members on the board.  RC has conviction that he can stage a turn around.  Most of us grew up gaming and remember that you couldn't find shit at anywhere other than Gamestop or EB Games.  Since EB Games got bought out by Gamestop, Gamestop became the only player.  We ALL know that gaming has seen a huge uptick in 2020 (COVID) and even before then.  How many of your friends' kids, your little nieces/nephews, your own kids are glued to a freaking screen?  Gamestop.com is now offering PC parts and there's been a lot of DD that Gamestop will start having build-a-pc kiosks which is amazing because you literally cannot do that at any other retail location. And don't forget their current online sales, they are already spectacular at 300% YoY!!  Yes, COVID drove online sales, but this isn't a dead company.  There's probably less risk buying GME at $50 than Apple at $2.   All the short's thesis of Gamestop being the next Blockbuster was built on hubris they've paid for that in the last few weeks.  They have again opened new short positions and those are now printing heavily, but how long will that last?  They probably still think that Gamestop is still the next Blockbuster, but it will just take a longer time to die due to the uptick of the new console release.  Short float as of yesterday 2/1/2021 was 226.42% according to this [source.](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today).  Cost to borrow was at 20-25% according to Ortex which is still insanely high. Regardless of winning position, they need to pay interest on their position.  Will that explode in their face again?  I believe it will when Gamestop has another big catalyst or there's the turn around story. Is the stock worth $80 right now?  I have no idea.  Is it worth $150?  No idea?  $30/share?  No idea.  Is Tesla worth almost $900?  No idea, but someone will pay almost $900/share for Tesla.  Here's something insightful that was posted right before all this GME madness took hold.  It's a great reminder on how and why we invest.[A Venture Capital Perspective on GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l0yzb5/a_venture_capital_perspective_on_gme/?utm_source=reddit&amputm_medium=usertext&amputm_name=wallstreetbets&amputm_content=t3_lbc758)I'm still holding 800+ shares and sold 4x 2/5 45p.  If the price does hit $45 on Friday, I'll take these shares and hold.
We need Ryan Cohen to announce GameStop is partnering with Tesla.
Lmfao GME is no Tesla. They aren’t changing the world. It’s a trash stock and the momentum from last week is gone and so are any hopes of the stock breaking out. Yall played yourselves
Tesla investors have been forged to Diamond hand. After investing in Tesla, no stock movement can phase me if I believe in something.I'm always borrowing money. I believe in me.
80% of the recent subs couldn't handle Tesla shares. Last year before Tesla split there was a point it was up to around 900 then dropped to about 200. This GME pull back is nothing for 💎 ✋. Hold strong and buy the dip. Get excited about voting on the future of gamestop.
And that is why I HOLD! I am nervous now, have been activley seeking out contrary views in the sea of confirmation bias, but the numbers just don't make sense.Maybe hedge funds are just far more clever than me (they are) but the extent of the disinformation campaign, shutting retail out from buying. Like that was pretty extreme, and I don't see them doing all that if exiting their position was this easy. Fuck it, they are shares. I can just hold them for 5 years until Ryan Cohen is president of the new united states and there will be a gamestop at every tesla charging station on mars.
This is the way I remember that crazy spike tesla had pre pandemic i was a gay bear and lost over 2k in puts. Back then I would buy and sell anytime the stock went down 1 dollar. I learned my lesson I Will hold either to the point where I can buy a fucking lambo and fuck 3 hookers or until im standing out side of a game stop asking for tendies
I have bought and sold Tesla so many times and probably made 50 bucks total.  Fucking hold!!!
Tesla and GameStop are very different and I don’t see them as comparable as a good long term hold.
Nio &amp Tesla both make electric vehicles and produce battery technology, AMC is a movie theatre amongst other things within the filming industry and GameStop is a video game/computer retailer, how are they 2 comparable apart from high short % ?it is obviously fucking coordinated. You don't even have to be retarded to see this.
Is tesla worth what it's trading at? No. They love when stocks are irrational when it benefits them, but hate when regular people take advantage of their mistakes. They over leveraged and we caught them with their pants down.
Ya. To be fair - $20 to $500 is pretty squeezyWhy we won’t squeeze:-Cost of borrow down (objectively from 30%s to teens on IBKR)-Melvin likely out, bailed by c-del who, whatever way, can manage position much better -deep ootm calls now exist (previously only up to $60) which makes hedging easier -peak media attention / euphoria / global interest peaked last week and has died off-volume has given shorts plenty of room to cover -ccac guy sold, Michael burry criticized price action, rod sold a bunch, so did Hubbard, Viking not really involved, dfv can do whatever the fck he wants at any time-Volkswagen was a completely different situationWhy we will squeeze -artificially suppressed buying comes roaring back -still one of the most shorted floats on Wall Street by most accounts-zero shares available for borrow on IBKR, Fidelity-zero notable insider selling (RC etc)-no offering from the company (they know stuff and hate shorts)-second squeeze, if there is one, likely won’t be halted by RH liquidity issues unless they want to destroy their biz forever -possibility for new strategic investments (blue sky like Microsoft, Sony, Tesla?, I don’t know) or friendly billionaires like Cuban to come in-retail has exhibited extremely strong hands and most are unlikely to sell between zero and $500 given what we went through last week ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
Tesla millionaires did this one very thing: hold. Yes some bet big dick money on options. But most held and still holding. Hold. Kind of a new thing for wsb since it was more of an options forum. I remember lurking back in the day when it was mostly crazy spy options. Look at us now, lol buying shares aka commons and holding. We are boomers. Was not only 6 weeks ago I’d read comments like “what’s a share?”....an option with no expiry. Wsb is compromised right now by hedgiees using our own psyche against us. Think you can create a gamma squeeze? Here’s some $800 calls, buy em up! Just hold. If you can’t hold then sell. But imagine selling - will you feel relief? Will you feel relief but keep checking GameStop? Will you feel relief when the price goes to $20? How will you feel if it goes to $828.49? Get out of your head. Make a decision. Breathe. Hold. 😳💩🥜🚀. I like this stock because of Ryan Cohens potential and I’m stupid but I’m believe I’m buying early. When the company is turned around and solid, I will sell calls and theta gang all those who sat on the sidelines during these epic last few weeks. Hold or get on the sideline and go play options on Aphria or some renewable energy buydem dips. Be well...
It is in people’s best interest to tell everyone GME is a once in a lifetime opportunity, but people are forgetting all of the Tesla millionaires we minted last year. There will be another, and another, and another. Maybe not with the same infinity squeeze potential, but with massive upside that you can easily make your fortune on. Learn from this one and persist. And remember the true measure of a man is not how he behaves in moments of comfort and convenience but how he stands at times of controversy and challenges.
Sold all of my Tesla to buy GME today
Spicy take with another theory/analysis that will probably get me downvoted to hell.tldr: If you want to see it moon, stop buying and selling options on this stock. It happened with tesla, and it's happening now. You saw the volume on the stock today vs options. If everyone on reddit is telling the truth, then we ARE the long volume. Redditors took profit, redditors bought more on the dip but there weren't the sort of huge volume you would see for this amount of volatility.There is not some magical cabal controlling this stock, there are individual investors, some of them institutions but still individuals making choices about when to take profit and what strategy to take.And every one of these individuals is a vulture who is trying to extract maximum profit from their positions. Even you. Some of you fought the ladder attack, some of you joined it.This ebb and flow is what prevents this sort of event from being an everyday thing. There is ALWAYS someone on the other side trying to counter your strategy. Jumping on the bandwagon or hedging against you. You don't need to imagine some sort of cabal manipulating the price down. If they could do that by themselves the price would never have gone about $20. It's not just the hedges now, you are competing against some guy named Bob who made 1 mil on the run up then sold off and yoloed it into puts. And 500 guys just like him with a variety of positions.The real villains here are the algos that have been using the IV to skim huge amounts of money by closing the options gaps as soon as they open up. Ask yourself who is taking those $35 dollar premiums on an 80 dollar price difference, can you trade fast enough to exploit that with low risk? Fuck no... but someone is.For all we know, we are fighting with ourselves now and the hedges are just trading on that artificial IV, with tools we can never have. If enough people stop buying and selling options then the price will stabilize on demand, and we represent a huge amount of demand.
My dads financial advisor told me to sell Tesla before it gets added to the S&ampP 500, those guys know jack shit
Nio and Tesla ran together like this for a bit
Same thing happened in my portfolio this summer in consumer tech. I read it as Tesla scooping up Apple and Shopify. Charts were keeping the same shape with different magnitudes for quite a while.
This is the way only using cash. Don’t use margin or loans. Only what you can afford but you won’t listen to me soooo.......I want a Tesla model S for each share of GME : $69,420 🤪💪💪💪🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🙌🙌
 i dont know about you guys, but I didn't hear no goddamn bell.trust me, even if it is hitting goddamn bikini rock bottom, it will sky rocket later. gamestop is in a great way to shift to e-commerce, several other analysts backing this up.and yes, the short squeeze didn't even happened yet, but again, even if it wont, GME has all the goddamn attention. and which stocks go up like crazy all the goddamn time? you guessed it. the stocks with the most attention. think about tesla. tesla is not better than any other car manufacturer, they have just a great marketing with elon.HOLD THE FRICKING LINE PUSSIES!
I sold $30 of Tesla shares to buy 1/3 of a share. So now across US and EU markets i own 2.3 Shares at varied pricing :D Not going to be life changing at all but if i can prevent the funds from getting a share, or part of one, then fuck it. Would love to be one of the retards with like £5k coming from this.

😂 I do love the way you autists think. It’s why Tesla is where it’s at today. I’ll be 💎🙌ing while breathing through my hopium ventilator
It’s comparing apples and oranges. Pretty much the same as saying GME will go to 800 because Tesla did
Why is this such a big deal right now and when Tesla blew up this didn’t happen ?
How can you retrieve the underlying in an ETF? The etf buys those shares to balance the portfolio. You can't just buy SPX and ask for delivery on say Tesla shares without ruining their balance.
How many corollas do I need to trade in for a tesla?
HOLD THE LINEIt’s the year 2031, I get on my Gamestop Airlines flight departing from New Gamestop and landing on Los Gamestop, as I drive my Tesla home. As soon as I get home I hop into my pool and once I get out my son Game Stop the third asks me about my “Deep Fucking Value” tattoo on my lower back. I look him deep in the eyes and tell him “Where he goes, I go, if he holds the line, I’m standing right next to him”.
Oh yeah - I was part of the April bears y’all were definitely laughing at us. But I rode Tesla to the moon today so it’s cool.
It’s like getting pre-split Tesla at below $250
As a 10YR tesla investor.  It's been an amazing lesson seeing how incredibly full of lies the financial media is.  All media.  Now with this seeing it all over my new feed.  Unbelievable.    Why is there no talking head on the news calling them on the utter BS lie?
It was Melvin Capital who went after Tesla for years and was extremely vocal about it. Not a lot of difference there I understand, but when this started he was taking some shots at Melvin directly due to this.
Even better, this is personal for him. Citadel is the same hedge fund that was going after tesla stock and trying to short them for years.
you miss the context. Every 3 weeks some retard figures out that SLV is undervalued, bets big on it and gets crushed. 1 year here and Ive seen it multiple times. It is like shorting Tesla.
Make it free for every Tesla owner. Since we will all roll out on Tesla’s after this, I see no downside.
if papa Musk is worried, he'll tweet 'i like tesla' and stonks go brrrrr
The company is better off but the existing shareholders just got diluted.  You now own less of the company than you did before.  It's also generally not a good sign that a company needs to raise money this way instead of by making a profit.  Good companies generate excess cash and return it to shareholders by buying shares back (which is the opposite of dilution it means that the existing shareholders now own more of the company) or through dividends.  In the case of AA and AMC it might be seen as less bearish because it's more about weathering the short-term covid storm than a long-term problem with the business (particularly in the case of AA)FWIW Tesla did the same thing.
We won't sell at $10,000I need the money to buy a Tesla model 3 Performance and I only got 5 shares. We need to bring this way beyond the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This should literally be pinned. FYI she called Tesla 2 years ago for the noobs.
It's okay if it "breaks the market". When it breaks the market in THIS direction, hedge funds have to liquidate their other holdings to come up with the cash (other holdings like Tesla, Netflix, etc). This means THOSE stocks will start to become affordable for us while they pay off our GME shares. We'll buy them up. We know to buy the dip. It's not a new trend.If a global pandemic couldn't keep the markets down for more than a few weeks, shares in 1 company won't ruin the global markets either.
A year ago I had barely 10k and then Tesla didn't stop _screeching ape squeeze noises_ 🦧💎👐🚀🍪and now I'm sitting on 100k lol I need this to happen one more time and I'll quit my job
Don’t forget Tesla. Where it all started. The catalyst of the propulsion to the moon.
Pls everyone text Elon Musk to announce a cooperation between Tesla and Gamestock! If he would do that the stock would go to the moon.
Hey guys, this is my two-cents:Hey retards and autists - *first of all my position is currently $GME 300 shares @ 315. Im not a financial advisor - more like a financial retard. Also, I am Norwegian and therefore please excuse my grammar. I'm doing my best.* # 1. We, the MARKET decides the priceSimply put - the Hedgies believe that GME is ready for chapter 11. That's why the amount of short position came to be that high as we see now. But at the same time, there is plenty of us that believe the contrary. We believe that the company has a fantastic future. GME is valued at 22B as of today. Now is that fair price? Who gives a shit. **WE LIKE THE STOCK**. Im going on a limb now and say that NONE of us are investing in stocks like Warren Buffet - like holding stocks until you die. Therefore, we buy stocks high and we sell high. Meaning the stock price doesn't fucking matter.Therefore RH and SEC and all the other complete retards out there, has nothing to say and should not manipulate a company's market capital. Look at Tesla they have path the way to value similar EV companies to a 25-100 P/S ratio. You didn't see this only 2 years ago.This is why I see that the stock price of GME as of now is not overvalued - and it is not a bubble. # 2. Everyone that is in the stock market, is following GME closely - many are invested - and many new will come We are upset. We are angry. AND we are **Bullish!**  Because of all the media coverage and the narrative this thing has become, we are actually not seeing investors flooding in because of FOMO, but because they don't want the other party to win. For every little fuck-up, hiccup and manipulation the MMs and brokers and the media pull on us, it will just build more momentum for "the little guys". This is a free market and the GME shareholders beat the HFs in their own game - and we are not FUCKING SELLING.# 3. Can you imagine if this was the other way around?Let's say, theoritcally, that the HFs looked at GME and saw that 140% of the stock was shorted and they used their small monkey brains to say "hey, I think this will blow up, if the share price increases. We should buy this thing" And the retail investor was the one who had shorted this stock into oblivion. Do you think MELVIN FUCKING CAPITAL would cry to the public and say WE NEED REGULATION TO PROTECT RETAIL INVESTORS?Fuck no, they would exploit the shiet out this situation and make us retail investors bleed to death. This makes the case of the outrage we see from the investors - because we know they only care about money. The good thing is that GME investors has been dealt the best hand at this poker table and WE RETARDS LIKE BOTH MONEY AND THE STONK. # 4. There is no way in hell the government will fuck the retail investor in the brownholeThis has become a political issue now and for the first time EVER both sides of the party agrees on one thing. WALL STREET SHOULD TAKE THEIR OWN FUCKING MEDICINE. Can you imagine the government will allow wall street to fuck over avarage joe again all around the world? NO. They are sick of wall street, and it is now the popular opinion to side with WSB and not Wall Street themselves. FUCK YOU. # 5. The retarded maths are pretty clear this stonk is on the way to PlutoThe past 10 days we have read from numerous retards that this is infact a squeeze that is bound to happen. You think 350 bucks is the ceiling? FUCK YOU BITCH, it's not. When the liquidty of the float drops, and all these shorts need to cover the stock will catch on a new upward momentum - however, at some point unfortunately it will literally go tits up, but by then the Hedgies have lost so much money, and we have won and GME is a reformed company. &amp#x200Btldr - JUST FUCKING HOLD, BE PART OF HISTORY AND WATCH THIS STONK GO TO 4200.69
Pick any blue chip / tech stock, and they'll be being sold to finance this.Hell Tesla is down to $788 as of friday from $830-850 - I'll bet that was deliberate because Papa Musk tweeted support for "Gamestonks !"
To be fair, Elon’s original Gamestonk! tweet was a huge catalyst for recognition of this situation by mainstream media and the Twittersphere.He did enough to gain brownie points for Tesla in my book.
Same. Tesla and Flamethrower for all my friends and family.
Was looking at the Tesla homepage yesterday, he should definitely make a new series: Model GME
I would 100% buy a Tesla if I could swing one from this
I’m starting to think this stock is going to just turn into the next Tesla stock just a constant short battle and people buying for no reason, BECAUSE THEY LIKE THE STOCK!! why sell when the possibilities are endless??
I bought Tesla stock with all $1800 of my savings the first week of March. My husband was about as disappointed in my stock "gambling" as I expected him to be, especially after it went down even further over the next three weeks. My diamond hands are still holding most of it, although I sold some for gme. We're both autists now.
Then we create the second longest squeeze in history after Tesla, and GME will eventually morph with Tesla and have babies playing videogames on Mars. I have spoken.
Yeah, made a fake account called WSBGod and claimed millions in tesla gains that ended up being photoshopped. There was some other stuff too, he was trying to profit off the sub. Wrote a book about it too.
There is nothing inherently wrong with shorting a stock. You make a bet that the company will be worth less. Sometimes you’re right (Luckin, Nikola) sometimes you’re wrong (Tesla, Herbalife, GME). What’s wrong is a system that lets people short more than the existence of shares and double down to try to bankrupt a company.
If it hits 20k and I sell I'll get a tesla starship with GME on the side
/u/PidgeonLover Could be Bert. Could be Nikola Tesla. The world may never know.
Thinking of selling one tesla share (sorry daddy Elon) and buying a few more gme, thoughts?
I see this ending in just a few ways.1. We all panic sell, and crash the stock. Really? After working in concert for weeks? 2. We withdraw slowly each selling a few shares at a time. People with 1 share will get out at the top. People with thousands will sell some shares at the top.Eventually only big share holders are left, and have sold a percentage at a profit, and small investors are out safely. 3. The Gamestop CEO uses this opportunity to remake the company into the next Amazon or Tesla, and we are in at the ground floor of a new era.I'm hoping for 3. We just gave him a second chance, i hope he takes it.A vitual city (mud) that the entry price is owning a share of GME?The Gamestop retail stores could have VR centers with live avatar purchases. Purchasing upgrades, plus a share of GME would be self sustaining, and profitable.
They’re pretty much the only company that didn’t require a bailout 10 years ago.https://www.barrons.com/articles/BL-FUNDSB-2847?tesla=yThey didn’t fire anyone either (although they did let go of some contracted employees once their contract was over). Even Blackrock and Fidelity can’t claim this.True, they do not have the cheapest fees on index funds, and their app has an ass UI. But they’re a really good boomer place to store your index funds and watch the 7% yearly returns, in case you’ve decided the heart attacks from watching $GME all this week was too much.*Am not a financial employee. But I am a Vanguard employee so I’m heavily biased.
Gamestop moves most sales online maintaining limited store presence, with brick and mortar stores retrofitted to have viewing rooms for live local gaming competitions / eSports viewingTesla charging stations installed outside of every single Gamestop to charge while you cheer. Pay to charge up and get a small Gamestop online credit to your account.AMC snackbars with popcorn and theater sodas in every Gamestop for your snacking-while-streaming needs and AMC is responsible for the projection hardware leased to Gamestop.Which meme stock company says no? Put this in play when the world is coming free of corona isolation and people are dying for some community and this is a trillion dollars idea.You're welcome Ryan Cohen, Elon, and AMC guy whoever you are idk.
Don’t buy a Tesla.... Do buy TSLA!💎🙌🏽
Did you reply "We don't have time to explain. Get in. We're going to the moon with a Tesla strapped to the rocket! 🚀🚀🚀🌙🌙🌙"
Retard, now you can live in a tesla.
They fucked with Tesla so many times I hope they get crushed. And if it works out I'll use their money to buy a Tesla. And it gets a WSB sticker if course
I still remember when CNBC was losing their mind over Elon being "dIsReSpEcTfUl" to a prolific short seller on an earnings call. Literally a guy invested in wanting Tesla to fail lol
They tried to say Tesla was garbage for years
“Just want to say that the Shortseller Enrichment Commission is doing incredible work. And the name change is so on point!”-Elon Musk https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/cars/2018/10/04/tesla-elon-musk-sec-tweet/1525673002/
In the spring of 2018, I fell into a deep depression that forced me to quit my job and was essentially rendered useless for 6 months. During the summer of 2018, a fellow autist told me to dump my life's savings into Tesla.Didn't give a shit about my existence at the time so said YOLO and made the play. Sitting here years later having made about $400k on it.
Fucking guy not too long ago who held Tesla calls from 2019 and turned 1500 into 1m or something stupid
Same I only have 3k real dollars on the line , the rest was imaginary Tesla money. Hold for 10k or bust !
I need a bro. I need a fucking brother right now. I need advice.I fucked up. I had a stop loss limit on and it sold my 61.5 shares at 140 this morning while I was driving to work. I thought I would be good because when I left the price was fucking 480. I didn't expect that volatility. COULDN'T BUY BACK BECAUSE OF FUCKING ROBINHOOD. I wouldnt mind losing 10 shares in a situation like this. BUT 61! FUCK.I bought at 40. I read my DD's, I read my DD's I sold my Tesla stock for this. One Yolo. One Shot. I fucked up my one shot at taking my foot off the gas pedal for a minute with life. I don't need to be teased or made fun of because of this, I know, I know I shouldn't have had a stop loss etc.If I buy at open I can only recover around 1/3 or possibly LESS of the shares of GME I had.OR.... Risk it again. YOLO -- fuck it and wait on a dip and recover it all. I know it isn't financial advice because we are all retards. Love you brothers and sisters. Been diamond handsing with the best of them for a long time on different accounts (this is a new one because I was once doxxed) but I slipped. Love y'all. Regardless I am buying again.&amp#x200BDunno if I wait on a dip or YOLO at open... I want an easy fucking life man. 🚀 🚀 🚀
Buy a tesla instead to support elon
It happens.My husband and I  missed out on the $12 million jackpot years ago, we missed out on bitcoins when it was $13 each, we missed out on the beginning of Tesla, and Sprint/Gamestop when they were so cheap.There will always be losses and missed opportunities, but the ones that got rich?  They probably had hundreds of losses before their luck turned around.Hang in there.  Your luck will turn around.
I fucking lose $75k last June selling naked calls on tesla (yes I know, RETARDED!). Did TD help me out? Fuck no they clapped my ass and collected their money IMMEDIATELY. I took my beating and lived to trade again. I fucked up, not elon for tweeting some bullshit or whatever catalyst blew my strike out by a mile. They didn't give a fuck about me entering the trade, and I don't need them holding my hand obviously, but them pretending to care about us now is infuriating. They'd happily allow me to do the same fucking trade again in a heartbeat. I'm legit going to be depressed when nothing happens about any of this and we somehow get fucked.
she already has one man, why do you think i work so hard, gotta pay for his fucking tesla
I was going to stay out of it,  but I sold my tesla to buy two shares.  All I could do, don't care if I loose it.They crossed the line when they pulled the crap they did this morning.Ape Strong
Just bought 140 shares this evening. Thanks to DFV for his initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world.Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under?I'm in this company because I believe in its status as a symbol of a modern age story of change, adaptation, innovation and community or grass-roots backed financing.If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry.GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality.People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight. Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike.Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children.GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest?Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it.I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this.Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides.I am not selling! Fired up and ready to fucking go!

I mean he doesn’t owe us shit but to be fair a large part of Tesla being as high as it is is due to WSB and no thanks to melvin and citron and other shorts...Juss sayin’
Elon with the 💎💎💎 nuts! This dude having our back is huge. I'm glad they shorted Tesla and he wants to see them pay 🚀🚀🚀🚀
This guy knows. Shorts almost bankrupt Tesla a few times. Imagine the innovation these fuckers would have robbed humanity of - all just to fill their pockets. Cunts.
When this is over I'm definitely buying some tesla shares. He deserves it, because he stands on our side
Papa Musk is the man... I will buy a Tesla with my GME gainzWe retards also buy stuff on Amazon. I think Daddy Bezos owes us a tweet.
I just went to SoFi and sold a bunch of my looooong held Tesla that I swore I wasn’t touching for at least 20 years and bought more GME. I was already in, but now I’m in deeper. Fuck Robinhood and fuck anyone who won’t let us decide what to do with our money. My wife’s boyfriend is gonna be proud. GME to the moon. 🚀💎🤲
 The year is 2041. I’m at home watching TV with my wife and kids. A trailer comes on for a movie called, “The Big Squeeze”. A single tear runs down my face. My wife puts her hand on my leg she knows. My kids say the want to see the movie, so we make plans to see it later that day. We get into our Tesla, in-part, powered by $BB. We’re driving down the street and pass a $GME. The kids say they really want to go there to build a new PC. Finally, we pulled into the parking lot of $AMC. As were are walking into the theater, I get a call on $APPL implant through the $NOK 5G network. It’s a call from u/deepfuckingvalue, and old friend.
Yeah who fucking cares I’ll take my $3.03 payout and get chicken nuggets or 0.00000001 shares of Tesla.
Was gonna sell my Tesla shares to buy more GME this morning but can’t.  That would be another $10k worth of GME @ $275 (currently) per share so that’s about another 36 shares they owe me.
one tesla per share
In 2018 I bought 5 shares of Tesla on Robinhood. I then forgot about it and literally never opened the app again until a couple hours ago. Shocked to see I'm up over 1000%.After reading up on GME over the past two hours, I'm sold. Tomorrow at open I'm selling all my TSLA, and buying all the GME I can, and will hold to $1000+.💎👐 are easy to have, just be a retard like me and forget you own the stock for 2 years.https://imgur.com/a/VCQ9zHs
This isn't just money for a house or a Tesla. If I get out of this alive it means paying off my sister's 50K student loans from nursing school. It means fixing up my pop's crumbling house. It means so much more to me than just me. And that's why I'm not. Fucking. Selling. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🐵 🤝 💪
I like that he did that.I like that we helped elon w/tesla.I like that elon helped us with his tweet.I like gme.I like amc.I like bb.But most of all, I like the $guillotine.
I really thought that we got shut down for good. I thought the men in suits were doing everything they can do, even go as far as take our freedom of speech. Which they are trying to do. I was mad, I saw the share price go down and I panicked a little. Then I realized something. I have the power. The shares that I own hold the power to wipe those meanies off the face of the planet. I came to the conclusion I’m not in it for the tendies anymore. I’m here for the change we are forcing upon Wall Street. I don’t care if the share price goes to zero, I will hold my shares to the day I die. My shares are ownership. Their shares are not. Their over extension is just an extension of their selfishness. They bet against an American business, I bet on an American business. The stage is set for the people to wipe their crusty old boomer ways off the face of the planet. At this point, they are just impeding progress for the future. They shorted Tesla, a company spearheading the future of transportation and clean energy. They short companies that have disruptive technology. They try and control the rate of change, the change the people want and need. When we act out against them they play the victim card. Enough is enough, we have them pinned up against the wall. It’s time to let them know whose in charge now. Let’s use this as an example of what a bunch of degenerates can do. I like the stock. I ain’t selling. Screw the men in suits.
Fuck the Lambo. Get a Tesla.  Or 10.
I don’t know what to say really. 12 Hours until the biggest battle of our trading lives. All comes down to tomorrow. Either we heal, as a team, or we are going to crumble. Share by share, dollar by dollar, until we’re finished. We are in it right now. And we can get the shit kicked out of us, or we can fight back. One trade at a time. Now I can’t do it for you. I’m too poor. I look around and I see all these autist, and I think, I made every wrong move a trader can make, I said Tesla can’t go any higher, believe it or not, that AMD was going out of business, and lately I sold GME at $30. When you get poor in trading, things get taken from you, you know but that’s trading. But you only learn that when you start losing trades. You find out that trading is a game of shares. The margin for error is so small, I mean one hour to early or too late and you miss it, one second to fast or too slow and you don’t quite hit it. The shares we need are everywhere around us. They are in every day, every minute, every second of trading. On this sub-Reddit we fight for those shares. On this sub-Reddit we tear ourselves and everyone around us to pieces for that share. We claw for that share. Because we know when we add up all those shares, that’s going to make the fucking difference between taking down these Wall Street assholes and losing. Between living and dying. I’ll tell you this, in any fight it’s the guy who’s willing to die who is going to win that share. And I know if I’m going to have any life anymore it’s because I’m still willing to die for that share, because that’s what living is. The ten shares in front of your face. Now I can’t make you do it, you’ve got to look at the autist next to you, look into his eyes. Now I think you are going to see a guy who willing to give it everything for that share with you. You’re going to see a guy who’s willing to sacrifice themself for this sub-Reddit because he knows when it comes down to it you’re going to do the same for him. Either we get ready now, as a team, or we die as individuals. That’s trading guys. That’s all it is.Now what are you gonna do?
Unemployed, in debt, and buys a brand new tesla? No offense but this is how poor people stay poor. 100k or whatever you have left is not as much as you think. And what do you mean 10k? Are you saying most of this is still in the market and could be worth half as much by open tomorrow?
I’m holding until I can whip my Tesla 🚀🚀🚀 back and forth between Mars  💎🙌🏼
I like the stock now and I will like it even more in my Tesla on Pluto 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
BUT THE FUNDEMENTIALS. IS TESLA WORTH ITS POSITION?
Wait, you're unemployed but you're buying a Tesla? This is the dumbest shit I've ever read.
Shorts caused Tesla to go up into the 800s post split. There's plenty of room. GME is very small, and fundamentally as a business, with the right pivots, they could easily be bigger than a company like Best Buy (which also fought Amazon years ago in the face of bankruptcy). Also, we have RYAN FUCKIN COHEN 💎👐🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tesla went to a thousand, did a 5:1 stock split, then rocketed to over 800 again. And the media wants me to think Reddit is the problem.
Good lord that reporter genuinely does not understand what the fuck is going on right now in the stock.  When Chamath mentioned Tesla and he just froze up it was fucking hilarious
$3.8M checking in. I’m not fucking selling till GME reaches $10,000. 9 figures or bust baby! Donating every single dollar to charity over the course of my life. Also, buying a Tesla roadster as a thank you to papa musk ☺️
Elon also probably knows that how high this stock gets has a direct impact on Tesla sales. I bet over 50% of the people in this sub have a number that "If GME hits $XXXX, I'm buying a Tesla with the profits". And its fucking awesome.
California to ban roofs that aren’t Tesla roofs 2025
It’s even more sketchy when Tesla is only profitable because of billions in regulatory credits passed by Congress
Tesla was ok, because the media was pumping it and the banks were behind it. GME is a target now, because they don't have their blessing. The kinds of misinformation and shilling for Tesla on YouTube in the past year has been unprecedented. The SEC never gave a shit. But if powerful people don't want GME to go up, they will attack us.We are just investors with a solid value thesis. They can disagree with us, but we are not spreading misinformation at all.
Your honor, according to the precedent set in the case of Tesla v. Gay Bears, bears are fuk.
When I saw people getting excited that interest was costing the shorts ~800 mil per day all I could think was the utterly massive loses that Tesla gave shorts. And those fuckers still short Tesla. The big fish in the stock market might get a little.but hurt when a trade goes wrong but they generally don't care. They will make it up with the next one and continue about their business.
Don't be a fucking idiot, SEC literally removed Elon from tesla board in 2018 cause he tweeted like a moron.  RC **has** to be safe, that's literally the reason for this whole thing
I dont see why they need to be the same price, we saw a similar thing with tesla and people were buying all the strikes. Buying one specific strike means that if the stock hits that point it gets an extra boost, but literally every call helps as long as its not 1 delta. Also, the lack of liquidity in gne means it is vastly more likely to see this type of squeezeAlso 115s are opening, these are much less likely to go itm and leave retail holding the bag instead of squeezing. Would not suggest those.  Would also not suggest everyone try to buy a single thing because that is market manipulation and we don't need extra crap about that right now.  Shprt and gamma squeezes are going to happen because hedge funds are run by morons, it doesnt require illegal manipulation to case that
Now imagine someone being like " well I was able to pay for brand new Tesla truck thanks to gamestop. " Boomers will be so confused.
Actual TLDR BB is setup to give every boomer automaker a chance to beat Tesla, Google and Apple when it comes to computer shit in the cars.
I sold my 7 shares of Tesla at 3:42 CT and followed the advice of my fellow autists on WSB, dumped my $6k in proceeds on 97 shares of GME, and made $417 in 18 minutes.
Sorry there's no pumping, there's no strategy. In the end, each person makes their own decisions. Gamestop just happens to be tremendously undervalued and the most shorted stock at the same time just like Tesla was. We trust Cohen to know what he's doing just like we trust Elon. Shorts keep pushing the same narrative and looking for excuses or someone to blame. Theyre pointing fingers when they can't even take responsibility for their own trades.
The other difference is that I missed out on Tesla
Yes and see his 2018 Tesla fail
As far as total value increase seen on this sub from an amount like 50,000$, yeah it’s gonna be hard to beat. Not many people have 50,000$ to yolo into a stock. But the guy that turned 500$ into a million on Tesla calls, I think is the best yolo I’ve ever seen. Everyone’s got 500$ to gamble not everyone has 50,000$
Squeeze your way to a milly bro, fuck you and go get yourself a Tesla, save the earth
the orbiting tesla made my day
Fuck that gay shit OP should buy a Tesla Model S and pick up hot chicks at college.
#$TSLA | Tesla Price Target Raised To $125 From $105 At JPMorgan🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
I remember the loss porn. It was a thing of beauty.In this retarded market any autist can make money with Tesla calls, we lost that. Also proof or ban.
You’ll be able to buy back in your tesla position once we’ve landed on the moon. 💎✋
Memes are getting too much at the moment. People karma farming with rockets 🚀 is starting to do my head in a bit. For me, WSB became a meme sub last summer when everyone hopped on Tesla. The proportion of good DD to memes is the lowest ratio its ever been on here. In terms of publicity and public eye, I think Pandora's box has been well and truly opened. I have 0 doubts that media outlets, cramer, all have interns positioned on here perusing and even trying to purport their own narratives. TLDR rockets 🚀 👩‍🚀
I did the same on Tesla. I worked my way from 10k to 150k and luckily I transferred 50k out, because I nearly lost the entire thing fomoing as Tesla went crazy last March. My advice to you is never try to win your money back right away, accept your loss and make sure you have a clear mind before reentering a position. I'm sure you already know that now, but it's always good to hear again. Good luck on the future, you clearly have it in you to win big again, patience 👍
A Tesla you say?
In the video he says he changed his mind on Tesla after shorting it and it going up. Also known as fucking failing lol. Then claims credit as it being a good investment and making 90% on shares without mentioning how much he lost before caving on his brilliant short strategy.
I watched and summarized his points so you don't have to watch his video. 1. The short squeeze won't happen - "Why is there a high short interest?"  - $40 - Open borrow at decent rate - Plenty of options  - Trading phenomenom - A lot of call volume 	- He has no problems selling the company higher 	- As long as borrow is available, insiders are still selling, and company needs money, there will be no squeeze2. Numbers don't lie - Citron was first short sellers to start going long on Tesla  - NPD report on GME. Harper Sales up 23%, GME down 9% - losing to Amazon, best buy, target, walmart  - Current business is drowning3. Valuations matter - This is a retailer, and valuation must be based on other retailers  - Analysts has $12 target on the price  - 2021 ebda - $330 million, street is at $71 million, Citron expects negative ebda 	- Target stock price should be at $26  - Trading at 40x ebda	- Apple is trading at 20x  - GME is expensive 4. Know who are on the opposite side of the trade  - Something about reddit being geniuses and he needs to get on Tinder  5. Company can become your biggest enemy  - $1 Billion in debt  - To make an acquisition they will need to sell a lot of stock  - Either this company will be JC Penny or Blockbuster
Imagine Elon tweeting that he's going to Gamestop, or just a picture of a Tesla outside of Gamestop
One thing I would say against this is that WSB could be picking up stocks that have already started moving and they start talking about them and riding the wave even if the big institutions are what is actually moving the stock. I don’t really know how to test this but just a thought. I don’t think WSB could move mega cap stocks like Tesla, but the recent move of a smaller cap stock like GME could plausibly be moved by WSB
Papa Elon going to tweet that you can now purchase Tesla with GME store credit
I can’t wait for the day tesla gets readjusted, it’s gonna be loss porn all over this sub.Nothing in Tesla is organic
also my playthere is no way this doesn't blow up in a tesla fashion with share split and everythingthe key was GME was valued too low to begin with
He felt Tesla was just too gourd to be true
Lol who the fuck invests in gourds, was Tesla stock just too mainstream?
That's the crazy thing, can't ever take a loss on a Tesla option, hold it till the last minute and pray Elon  creates a meme and that shit will soar
For anyone wondering, I went in 20k at $40 and 11k at $34, I do not have fuck you money, however I do have a job that allows me to be a bit bold. I will not be so careless next time and do more research.... UNLESS TESLA GOES APE SHIT MONDAY TO FRIDAY LOLOLOLOL
+1Banking on a squeeze on Tuesday or even next week is retarded. It could happen, but I'd be happier myself seeing the squeeze dragging out over months, Tesla style, which is a very possible scenario given the firepower on both sides. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I don’t want to get left behind this is the best god damn sales pitch I’ve ever heard on Reddit.  fuck the economy . Fuck Tesla. Fuck business school 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
My man's gonna hold tesla till his grave, never even gonna spend a dime...
If you've watched Tesla for long enough you start to realize how blatantly fake all the news is and the analyst are fucking retarded.  That cramer video explains it all.
Serious question.How many people read Seeking Alpha 's articles?They get publicized in investing.com and a lot of other sites.And why a definitely-biased-article is any different from a definitely-biased-post?Both are written by somebody who calls himself an analyst (in WSB it means he likes receiving anal, though).Both gives read on the situation of a stock, its management and gives a conclusion that can be translated as "it may go up" "it may go down".If somebody follow up and buy a stock, why is this a problem?In the same discussion, if somebody on Twitter with a lot of followers said "Tesla is overpriced IMHO" and the stock tanked because a lot of people believed what this person said, why is that a problem?
Wallstreet: Blackberry is an phone company that sells phones just like Tesla is an car company selling carsWsb: Blackberry is an security software company that sells endpoint security software that sells at an PE ratio of 6 end of this year!
&gt His bet was the stock would increase appx 270% to reach the $690 strike.Your math is way fucking off. Oct 25th, 2019 the price was $328. He only needed 110% to hit his strike price.In the 4 months preceding his 'purchase', Tesla had already gone up 77% from $185 to $328. It was still one of the most volatile stocks. No fucking way he got those contracts for that price.
Tesla was still a meme back then. Remember Elon's "gonna take Tesla private at $420" tweet? In the 15 months preceding OPs so called bet, Tesla went from $250 to $370 to below $200. It still had crazy IV. No way he got the contracts for that price.
This was bought before Tesla became the meme juggernaut. The Cybertruck and everything after made Tesla IV ridiculous ever since.
Low IV and good Greeks. During that time Tesla wasn’t volatile like it is now
I've got 100k of margin available. For every 100 upvotes this gets, I'll buy 100 more shares in it. It's all going against my Tesla shares so it's gonna be one YOLO or the other that rides me to Valhalla, shiny and chrome.
With that logic he owns part of Tesla too.
for real. I'd make the argument this is the best WSB play of all time, for the following reasons:1) Everyone doubted him hardcore the entire time, and he calmly shrugged off the doubt and held anyway2) Despite being up 10x on his investment (read: calculated gamble), he held all the way until now for a 70x on a 6 figure inflow. 3) He was at one point down 50%, and continued to hold, even through the covid crash where everyone else was bankrupting themselves on spy puts4) When he finally began to pull out he didnt even completely exit. He BOUGHT SHARES to help the short squeeze and everyone on wallstreetbets. And made out even more from it.5) A large part of his calls expired the WEEK before an explosive run fueled by Jim Cramer tweeting, with them being 13% OTM last week and now the strike price of which is currently half the share price. Madness.&amp#x200BDFV, you inspire us all. The lesson here is do some god damn research, stick with your conviction and buy leaps, not 0dte tesla fds.
&gtthank you for your comment. We obviously know WSB and their love for the number 420,69 (clearly, WSB is close to infinitely more famous than we are). We always thought this number was patented by the Tesla stock. Is this information outdated? Overall, FS Associates and WSB seem to have slightly different approaches to investing. Nevertheless, we have respect for WSB and are aware of their huge impact on retail investing. lol.
Investing in Tesla is not investing in SpaceX.Get over it.
&gt	Tesla holders are stubborn afUntil they see a -25% day and see their $1M profit become $750k in one day. Then another -20% the next day. Uh-oh just lost half the profit you earned over a year in 48 hours. I take it you haven’t seen bubbles pop before? It takes a long time to climb up a mountain, but it’s a very short trip falling off of a cliff.
Plot twist: It's Michael Burry, but the actual one not the Christian Bale version. And he just sits in the back of your Tesla and won't shut up about how overvalued they are as a company, completely overlooking everything else while you eat your tendies on full self driving at 120 on the PCH
Remember when Elon said Tesla shares were overvalued so it mooned for several months afterwards?
He may be early on shorting Tesla but he’s not wrong. Too bad that’s the same thing.
Tesla didnt rocket like this. Steady gains over months is not quite as crack like as 60 percent in one fucking day.I bought more GME today, lol
Regular lurker here but I didn’t realize till now in Mr. beast’s post someone comments, “I’m gay” and another person replies, “you heard the man, short Tesla.” Im crying laughing.
Cheer up buddy, they only have paper gains........ just kidding, I am sitting on a stash of $1mil of Tesla from my original $100k investment last year.
Went to Bengaluru in 2016 for work. If Tesla cars can self drive there, they can self drive ANYWHERE lol.
That delivery driver better be a Tesla millionaire if they're quoting him.
Telsey sounds like Tesla. GME @\`1000 EOW confirmed.
&gtcollecting cans it is.Damn right.  Those aluminum Tesla frames arent going to make themselves.  Lets'go!
Tesla goes up 274926482% *ok*Goes down 7% **tHe bUBbL poPPed**
Yes it will be 1037 at approximately 1/28 10:36 amReason: Tesla goes up usually
This sub is the most flip floppy place I swear. 3 days ago you could be downvoted to the earth’s core for questioning Tesla lol
If you fomo bought tesla at the top and are shitting your pants, thats what you deserve.
I am expecting a stimulus bill late next week whereby the government will purchase a Tesla to launch into space for scientific purposes and the cost of the Tesla will be $1 trillion. COGS will be like $80k. Literally can't go tits up.
I know rite??? These fake ass gurus out here acting like they William Buffet and shit.They can learn a thing or two from me, I'm a bit of an expert. Bought Tesla at $500 when the whole world was like "nah, I aint buying Tesla". I was frfr the only one buying. It's lonely at the top. Cashapp me two easy payments of $9.99 and I'll share my secrets wit u
there is huge open call interest for 15-Jan because not only is it the third Friday of the month but there's a bunch of LEAPS people bought the last few years that are expiring.  i think there may be a lot of sell pressure on calls this week as people avoid taking assignment, especially for retail traders who bought short-dated OTM calls the last few weeks who may not even have the capital to take assignment of $70,000 worth of Tesla for one $700 ITM call.  call selling may drive the stock down since there would be less shares that need to be bought or held in order for the original options writers to make delivery.that was my thesis anyway.  i bought a few puts last Friday, just a small speculative position.
When the fuck wil palantir be at 900 like fucking tesla
Tesla was never valued at $.33. Even accounting for the split. This is a post of lies.
Tesla is making a convertible? $1000 EOW
$25,000? damn i'll be able to afford one. And at this rate my tesla shares will pay for it.
What kind of tesla is this?
Tesla to $2000 by the end of the year.
JFC if I have to read correlations between the dotcom bubble and Tesla one more time I’m fucking deleting my Hotmail account.
Of course everyone looks smart when 60% of this sub is exclusively holding Tesla calls
Tldr: Use student loan money to buy Tesla leaps to pay off student loans. 🚀🚀🚀
&gtI saw a lot of retards here shitting on the battery swap, and those people are dumb af. First you need to understand that not every Chinese lives in a house like most Americans do and a lot of them don't have charger installed at home or a fixed parking spot to park their cars.Whatever happened to that Tesla battery swap that they showed off at one of the conferences a few years ago - showing how it was faster than fueling a conventional car?Did that idea just die?  I thought it was pretty cool/practical.
Good thing you had another chance last year with Tesla. I'm sure you remembered and went all in right?
Fuking Ford, lost money each time. I was listening to freaken    news people that Tesla was overpriced since March of last year. Fuk Ford, would of been a millionaire if I listened to WSB and bought Tesla.
Amazon stock price lost 90% during that bubble, can we expect the same for Tesla before it recover and become trillions dollar company 20 year later?
Honestly this is smart.  2k shares is right around 1.8 mil.  Put that in some boring ETF or dividend stocks and you could pull 70k per year with the 4% rule and never run out.  Plus you'll have another 1000 shares of tesla which is more than enough and will probably be worth another 3 mil in 5 years
over 2000 tesla shares. He IS your wifes boyfriend.
It's about personal risk tolerance. You've made 26x. Trying to extract more seems the height of greed. How pissed would you be if Tesla dips at any point? Not saying sell all by any stretch, but the saying that nobody ever went broke taking profit rings true here. There's so much positivity being priced into Tesla that I'd be comfortable paring down the position, letting half ride, book over a million in gains and think about how to invest the rest. Just my $.02.
Are you though? If Musk wants to get a trillion dollars to do a massive global company to do carbon recapture (and earn massive money from the credits) then he can do that by creating the "X" holding company for Tesla, SpaceX, Neurolink, Starlink, Boring Company, etc.And at that point not only will he be reducing global CO2 but each share will be worth whatever a Mars city is worth. $10,000? $100,000? Remember how the holding company Berkshire Hathaway had (has?) $100,000 shares.
Guy put 150k into tesla. you think he couldn't before all this?
Of the whole automarket. Turned out the industry was undervalued by half, and that half was Tesla. Who knew. (besides this guy, ofc)
I work in PWM, and I might caution you on this....I’m not sure who you’re borrowing from (and no way you’re locking in 2.5% over the long term unless rates stay rock bottom), but...you will probably be limited to borrowing 50% of the value of your Tesla shares (if not less because it is so volatile). And what happens if Tesla takes a dip, even if only temporarily? Your bank will likely want you to pay up because your loan will no longer be collateralized. I am just saying it is not as simple as you’re making it out to be, and you could very well end up screwing yourself over.
Sell half and put it into something that pays a dividend. You can still barrow against it and the dividend on that much would probably pay the loan. JEPI....if you put a mill in that, the dividend would be $8900 a MONTH!!! Bet that would make your house, Tesla, and boat payment. You could use the leftover to buy more Tesla if you wanted. Dude don’t be a MC Hammer story!!!
Risk management issue. You don’t actually have that money until you sell. Who knows what happens in your life over next 50 years. Enjoy your money gradually, and steadily, over time. You ain’t “rich” until that shit is in your bank account. But seriously, congrats on hitting the Tesla jackpot. It’s likely once in a lifetime so don’t jeopardize it. 🍻
Cheer up mate. I got in with 60 shares of Tesla today at $879.
A $20 move in Tesla stock is about 8 months of Tesla revenue. So today Tesla stock went up 2 years worth of revenue.
Important question: was he driving a Tesla? 🚀🧑‍🚀
A $20 movement on Tesla is the entire GDP of BosniaSo theoretically enough money was made today to create 3 Bosnia’s
imagine if elon went to prison for masticating in public and  tesla took a shit before he sold and he lost half his money.... imagine bro
One of the director was telling me that it was crazy how inexpensive apple was and that its sucked for the people who lost money when the stock went down in august. (talking about the fucking split) He was also telling me that he didn't understand why not much people bought the dip when tesla went from 2300 to 400.
Ran out of condoms and told my gf I'm a pull out king. Went in raw and found out I'm king of shit. She now preggo and I need Tesla to go $3,000 eoy.
Congrats to OP but this is def bittersweet. Coulda kinda maybe quit any job and scrapped plans to have any future jobs investing in Tesla in 2010 and holding through the decade.
I was playing with my hot wheels and spending 100% of my net worth on chocolate ice cream when this guy bought Tesla for the first time.
Anyone else not lose money but MISS OUT ON OVER 10 FUCKING THOUSAND CUZ YOU PAPERHANDED TESLA, THIS RETRD DID
Why do people give anecdotal evidence like this and act like it’s meaningful? We know exactly how many cars Tesla has sold.
Tesla to 2k 2023
He did.  He immediately bought more Tesla shares.
Shorting Tesla is insane. At the same time please reinvest wisely. Tesla is essentially a cryptocurrency at this point.
Yeah the downside of being the first guy to be right is that you lose a lot of money while your prediction doesn't happen.He's 100% right, Tesla will crash eventually. It's very reminiscent of MSFT and others in the .com bubble. But that doesn't mean there's not money to be made now. Just be aware of the risk.
I just bought more Tesla yesterday and I was like knowing my luck it’s going to go down tomorrow BUT TOMORROW CAME!
DON'T fucking tell anybody about your Tesla Shares / Wealth. Nobody.Don't fucking sell them either, even if they crash 40% over the next couple of months.Build you wealth, and when you're 35 and not having to put up with corporate bullshit (semi-retired) and you have a long term girlfriend that isn't sucking your cock because of how much she knows you have in the bank, then you're sorted.
There is a lot of speculation going on so if you made bank congratulations. İf you are bagholding a shitty company just move on. I lost so much money in 2009 still hurts.  I'm kind of expecting big players to short the fuck out of the market and take all our profits very soon. The good thing is fed is going brrr daily and giving it to companies so companies worth more also usd is low so whatever your gains are just took 10 off for currency risk. Low usd also means that exporters will grow faster than the market. I made my profits and moved on from Tesla and now researching exporters for short term gains.
This is what happen when we work together and kill all the Tesla bears.
This is fucking gold! I’d give you some if I didn’t have every cent in Tesla right now 🚀
Don’t get emotionally invested in Tesla because it’s done well for you. If you feel it’s overvalued, get out with no regrets.
When I’m driving my tesla across mars in 20 years have fun sitting on earth making burgers for the trumps
Why does every Tesla fanboy tell people calling Tesla a bubble to short it when the #1 rule is never short a bubble
Owning tesla is confirmed infinite money glitch
Michael bury just transferred all the gains from the big short into the pockets of Tesla shareholders
Tesla in 2 months: “hello, nice to meet you I am 2 trillion dollar company”Tesla Revenues: “we made 65 profits this quarter”
Tesla could easily lose 95% of its value and it would still probably be fundamentally overvalued based off current cash flow. Now we all know fundamentals don’t mean shit but it’s a possibility.
Based on linked in this guy was at google preipo (I heard avg employee made 5m in pip in 2005!) . And worked in tech for almost 20 years. I would be very surprised if tesla stock ( and this account 6 of 6) is more than half of his nw.  So not you avg wsb retard. Not one of us.
At $1,000, it is a $14M position.Considering that Tesla will never ever pay a dividend, how else would you capitalize on the share price appreciation without selling the shares? I suppose you could live on margin, but Tesla is so goddamn volatile that there is a possibility the bottom could fall out at any point.
Even if Tesla popped he’d be a millionaire. Love the dedication. Gratz, and fuck him.
Imagine having like 12 700 shares of Tesla. The CC premium from playing theta gang would be ridiculous
Your guts are going to be splayed over the floor if you buy Tesla puts on a hunch.
Who else is still on the sideline with tesla? 🥳Been too scared since 2017
Is that still the case?  Tesla still have negative cash flow and is this a massive bubbles. My gut says yes
2015 people complaining that Amazon won’t ever be profitable and it’s a scam they don’t pay taxes. 2020 Tesla is nothing like cash flow positive Amazon who is a profit generating machine.People will forever sit on the sidelines and complain while early adopters get the tendies.
Losing money companies means immune to Biden taxes. Tesla fair value is $2 trillion right now🚀🚀
This is true. While Amazon generates profits for themselves to make money, Tesla is a loss making company - making other companies lose money.
Easy. Bonds are overvalued, interest rates are low. people are looking for any sort of yield. Risk assets make the most money = Buy tesla.
&gtbut Tesla is quite literally going to the moon.And once SpaceX goes public it's quite literally going to Mars. Elon will be the first trillionaire
I haven’t been keeping up with stocks as much so I literally thought this article was satire and was some r/wsb circlejerk thing. Holy shit, Elon is now the richest?? That is mindblowing to me, he had like a net worth of 12 billion like a year ago iirc. I really thought Bezos would never be surpassed but Tesla is quite literally going to the moon.
If you think about how many times per week you use Tesla compared to Amazon which only provides groceries, displaced the entire retail sector, and hosts the entire internet this makes perfect sense. I myself bought 8 Teslas so far this week and it's only Tuesday.
MFW I sold 30k worth of Tesla now worth multiple millions of dollars
Simply because Tesla has more share in the market.Bezos is one stock split away from reclaiming back that title.Boomers and Millenials would devour 500$ shares of Amazon if they could.
Lmao I dumped my roth IRA into Tesla last Tuesday and I'm up 5k now. Fuck I should've done this 2 years ago
&gtTesla is undervalued  &gt  &gtI am kinda retarded to be able to do the math Sounds like legit DD, can't go tits up.
Im having multiple kids just so they can push tesla stock upwards
Dude holy fuck, do a fucking spread and stop taking unnecessary naked risk. Literally buy a 06/18 $800c and sell a $1100c. You’ll make fuck you money if Tesla stays under $1100 as of 6/18 since you’ll retain all the credit. Same investment right now. On any fat dip, buyout the $1100 for peanuts compared to what you sold it for and you have a cheaper naked $800c, lol
You couldn't have just bought tesla calls?
Congress should just include two shares of Tesla in the next stimulus check.
yeah he YOLOD his last 30m into Tesla last march and in true WSB fashion was either going to broke or get rich.
Bought a Tesla in March, now it just sits in my garage I have no where to go.
Bankrupt Elon musk and Tesla.
No joke, he normally tweets like this when he is in a good mood. He gets in a good mood when Tesla is doing really well. Tesla has probably beat it's delivery goals despite them losing a full quarter of production from covid shut downs. Tesla to 900 in February.
We now know the correct answer to “why did the chicken cross the road?” -To buy Tesla calls
&gtretard In a joking way AND a literal way.  There is no benefit to saying you made a million dollars off of tesla.  But when you think about it, the people who made WAY more arent saying ANYTHING.   This guy wanted his ego stroked, which is a key thing a fool does.There are people here that have made way more than that off of other stocks.
I’m Melon Usk and I became a millionaire by investing in Tesla! You can too!
Guys we need to talk about Tesla going to 630 to 695 in 20 minutes lol.

He invested in Tesla. You invested in Blackberry.
I'm tired of seeing these damn Tesla millionaires, when I can barely afford a cup of coffee with my BB stocks that were supposed to moon yesterday.
Everyone knows that on Monday morning, ahead of the opening, Tesla will be added to the S&ampP 500! That makes today's closing price the big one. Oh, by the way, today is also a quadruple witching expiration event..LET'S ALL THANK ELON FOR THE TENDIES!!!!
Gutsy to bet against Tesla
You had the chance to buy Tesla at 37$😨
He sells covered calls at 25% OTM. So Tesla right now is at $650. He sells 15 $800c for January 8. That pays him a $22000 premium. But he doesn’t wait for it to expire, he cashes out at about 50% and does it again. He doesn’t do it during weeks of expected large price swings. I think. I’m dumb too so idk. I do something similar but instead of getting $22000, I get $22.
Rule #1 of trading. Don’t short Tesla.
Tesla: We will be offering $5 Billion in shares.-----/r/investing : I bought TSLA at $300 and I will be holding 50 years. Rest of my money is in VOO.-----/r/options : Put pricing still looks good. Will probably try to sell some. Buying calls may be risky but lots of upside with institutional volume. Hedge your longs and stay away from low delta.-----/r/stocks : I've been investing for only 6 months and I am up 30% on my portfolio. All my portfolio is in tech. Did I mention I'm only 18?-----/r/wallstreetbets : I will gargle my own piss and drink Lord Elon's cum if TSLA hits $700 end of week. Fuck me in my tight mouth daddy!
the individual or institution who wrote the options contract is liable for it. said party probably owns thousands upon thousands of tesla shares and was writing "covered calls" - but the loss ultimately ends up with them. the only way the losses are distributed is if the original writer realized their mistake early on and BOUGHT another (exact same strike) contract to cancel out each one they sold at any point between last summer and now. and then the individual who wrote THOSE options could further split the losses by doing the same thing, and so on and so on.if any of this needs to be further explained let me know
For lazy people:&gtAccording to analysis by S3 Partners, short investors in Tesla— those who placed bets in the market that its shares would lose value — have lost $35 billion on those positions so far this year.&gtTo put that loss into context, the US airline industry posted combined net losses of $24.2 billion, excluding special items, through the first nine months of 2020, the worst losses the industry has ever reported.
He’s #2 that means there’s still room for Tesla to grow 🚀
Nio is over there sounding like a Chinese military squadron in its briefing and Tesla is over here messing around with flamethrowers, tequila and cookies.
BREAKING NEWS: SNP 500 TO BE ADDED TO TESLA STOCK
1 million dollar Tesla call yolo
My fuckin sister messaged me on Sunday saying she had a gut feeling on Tesla this week. I told her to fuck off....
I bought Tesla at their IPO and it's paid for much of my life in the ~10 years since. I did the same with Palantir. Figured this is worth sharing, conclude what you will.
Ok because you guys are actually too stupid to understand how this works, I'm just going to copy and paste from Matt Levine.TLDR: Robinhood profits because retail trades are random, so HF traders can actually get a small spread. Your prices will be better than institutional prices (so we're winning at the expense of the big boyz).  &gtRobinhood’s business model is:  &gt  &gtCitadel gives it money.  &gt  &gtIt uses the money to give you free stock trades.  &gt  &gtThat really is taking money from the rich (high-frequency traders) to give to the poor, sort of (millennials who want to trade stocks on their phones). Who did you *think* was giving it money?  &gt  &gtNot only that. Payment for order flow really is “one of the most controversial practices on Wall Street,” but [the controversy tends to be confused and obfuscated](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-02-25/-flash-boys-exchange-isn-t-about-the-little-guy). The basic idea of payment for order flow is that electronic market makers want to be left alone to quietly make the spread: They want to buy stock for $99.99 and sell it at $100.01 and clip two cents on each trade. If their orders are random—if sometimes people buy and sometimes they sell, with no pattern—then that works out well for the market makers. But their big risk is what they call “adverse selection”: Sometimes, when a customer buys 100 shares at $100.01, it then buys another 100 shares at $100.02, and another 100 shares at $100.03, and keeps going until it has bought 10,000 shares and pushed the price up dramatically. The market maker who sold it the first 100 shares—and who is probably now short and needs to go out and buy those shares at a higher price—has been run over.  &gt  &gtThis is a risk of being a market maker on the public stock exchanges: Sometimes you sell 100 shares to a small retail investor and it’s random noise other times you sell 100 shares to Fidelity and you get run over. But if a market maker can guarantee that it will *only* interact with retail customers—if it can filter out big orders from institutional investors—then its risk of adverse selection goes way down. The way the market maker does this is by paying retail brokers to send it their order flow, and promising those brokers that it will execute their orders *better* than the public markets would. (This is called “price improvement,” and allows the retail brokers to fulfill their obligation to give their customers “best execution.”) So if a stock is quoted at $99.99 bid, $100.01 offered on the public exchanges, the market maker might buy it from retail customers for $99.991 or sell it to them at $100.009. (It’s not usually *much* price improvement.) It can offer a tighter spread than the public markets—and have money left over to pay the retail brokers—because it doesn’t have to worry about adverse selection. If the retail broker is, say, one designed to let young people day-trade for free on their phones, then those orders are probably particularly valuable, because they are probably particularly random.  &gt  &gtThere are two objections to this practice. One is that it is bad for investors whose orders *aren’t* sold to market makers, the institutional investors who instead trade on public stock exchanges. Payment for order flow fragments the markets, takes retail order flow away from the public stock exchanges, widens out spreads on those exchanges, and, by segregating retail and institutional orders, makes institutional execution worse. This objection is probably true! If you’re a hedge-fund manager, you should dislike payment for order flow, because it makes public markets worse for you. (If you invest through mutual funds, as I do, you should also dislike it, for the same reason.)   &gt  &gtThe other objection is that payment for order flow is bad for investors whose orders *are* sold to market makers, the retail investors whose orders never touch the stock exchange. If the market makers are paying to get their orders, surely they are doing something nefarious with them, right? Otherwise why would they pay? This objection seems mostly wrong. Very occasionally there is some evidence of [market makers doing naughty stuff](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-10-01/tesla-will-try-to-be-more-normal) with the retail orders that they buy, but for the most part, particularly for simple market orders, the result is straightforward: Retail customers are instantly able to buy stock at a price at least as good as, and usually better than, the best price available in the public markets. And the market makers pay their brokers for the privilege, so the brokers can offer cheaper (even free!) stock trades. They are unambiguously better off than they would be if their brokers didn’t sell their orders.  &gt  &gtSo by selling its customers’ orders to market makers, Robinhood is actually stealing from two sets of “the rich”: Rich market makers like Citadel are paying it directly for the orders, while rich hedge-fund managers are getting worse execution on public stock exchanges so that Robinhood customers can get better executions off those exchanges. Big institutions are paying to subsidize free trades for Robinhood’s customers. It feels pretty Robin-Hood-y! If I were Robinhood I would advertise that!

Ashes to Tesla to ashes, dust to cocaine to dust
Well frendos I cracked $300k this year. Back in 2015 all I had was $300 to my name and $80k in debt. Most thanks to Tesla, bought at $180 pre split and it catapulted my journey to being an prick that don’t take shit from da man no mo

Bruh where’s tesla?
i was on the shitter, thinking 4k in my bank account wasnt enough. so i deposited almost all ofit into tesla calls cus WSB IS LIFE. held and took a 15% loss on the day. but held through the day and made it thru to the other side
Go buy a tesla
Bullshit, Elon knew, that's why he sold Tesla tequila at $250 a bottle, limit 2 per person. 250x2=500, SP500 motherfucker.Elon was telling all of us to buy his tequila to celebrate! Just like when he was selling short shorts!
yolo tesla weeklies until january guaranteed 100% returns every week gg fellas
Knowing Tesla it will be down 3% for no reason tomorrow - then rally next Tuesday instead
“The young surviving cub, nicknamed ‘Einhorn’, was struck by a stray Tesla driver later that day”
Citrons short reports are usually based on finding fraud. All they could find for Nio was “overvalued and Tesla might lower prices”Weakest shit I’ve ever heard
Imagine buying a model S yesterday and then this fucker drops the price $3k for a meme. Imagine working triple overtime at Tesla because Musk berates his employees about meeting unrealistic production goals being the only way to break even and then he just cuts the price of their flagship product 5% for a meme. I can't help but feel like he is going to cause some bad blood with this one.
I actually have some insider knowledge about Tesla after battery day. The stock is poised to move from the left side of your screen to the right side.
Should've bought 3/19 Tesla calls instead. Smh
Tesla calls at open tomorrow all in

If I see one more Tesla post I’m going to shoot my balls off
They were to begin with, they fucking named themselves Nikola to try to act as if they were on a level with Tesla.  I've been laughing at then from the start.
If you think about it. Our trucks are moving through the solar system at 10,000 meters per second. Beat that tesla
I like the subliminal Tesla logo in the back )
So what you're saying is I should buy more tesla calls?
Imagine all the dirt bag "money managers" selling these shares to clients over the last few months."Bro, Randy, was I not right about Apple? You gotta get in on this early, this is the next Tesla. The analysis at our firm have already lifted guidance to $230! Now can we talk about your life insurance, I'd really like to fuck you there as well."
Tesla will be known as a company!
If Elon doesn't release a GIF of a Tesla semi driving up hill hes fucking up.
dude also said "STONKS ONLY GO UP" and is on the Tesla bandwagon.   99% sure he's lurking here.
My god. In less than a year we hit 420, had a 5 to 1 stock split, and hit 420 again. Wtf is wrong with us? Why would we buy any stock but Tesla ?
Look at me. I’m the Market Driver NowEdit: Damn thanks for the award. But should have bought Calls on Tesla instead of splurging on this.Double Edit: Goddammit stop giving me awards. Is this how  you bastards pump up stock. Stahhhhp. Bloomberg is watching.Triple and Final Edit: Screw it, gonna cash in those awards and get those calls on this awesome company called Nikola. Heard it’s so fucking advanced it puts Elon and his Tesla to shit. Gravity Drain Power Train and Green all the way. See you suckers with my Nikola Badger and and Gravity powered Learjet in the future.
I'll run virtual android devices in my pc and just continually download the Tesla app
Uploaded a fake Tesla app to app store that buys puts every time you open it
Just deleted my Tesla app and bought a put
That's a great idea, "trading on a margin" is the right way to start as a beginner.But if you're limit is 19,400 why not using them all? Tesla is a great choice for this type of investment, nothing could possibly go wrong. Consider also nkla, a safer option compared to Apple with more room for growth.
Alright. 50k on margin to YOLO Tesla calls it is. This is the WAY
Very. Lets be real for a second. 25k can make a huge impact to your life. A new car, a credit for your first house or a backup in case you have some huge emergency in your life. Call me boring put most of that money in a trust fund / ETF and maybe put aside a few thousand bucks to play with. Remember, for every gain-porn post you see here there a thousands who loose it all. And besides, looks like tesla already tool off, so Id be careful now.

Just a reminder Tesla hit 420 today. Funding is secured boys.
&gt It was something where the price of Tesla stocks needed to go down for him to make money? I don't know how it worked to be honest, all my money just goes into mutual funds.fucking lol
Realistically, this guy is gonna spend 2k on hookers, 1k on chicken tendies, and then lose 27k in Tesla puts.
if you read through this post, the guy made all of it on tesla puts.&amp#x200Bwe should mod this guy
One of the few and rare lucky tards who got his tendies from the run up and went and bought a Tesla.
Where was the support thread for all the bears that got massacred by tesla???
I was gonna sell my Tesla calls until I got highI was gonna get up and collect tendies but then I got highMy account is still red hot and I know whyBecause I got highBecause I got highLa lala lala
Fucking Tesla!!! Why did I hold over the weekend
If Tesla drops another 10% tomorrow I will have my ribs surgically removed and suck my own dick.
I’m sorry I made Tesla go down today. I bought 2 shares and I forgot to warn you all that whenever I buy Tesla it goes down.

Once in a lifetime?Overstock went from $4.60 at the end of March 2020 to $121 in August 2020, 25x **on shares**.In the same timeframe Tesla did 5x shares.
I can’t stand the fact they named their company NKLA. Like come on man Elon got Tesla just go with something original. Sounds like they made the name and started pretending to be Tesla.
You need to look a little deeper man.  Musk got hair plug transplants, and since then he’s become extremely powerful. That’s plug power. Or, Plug Power ($PLUG) which does hydrogen power!  Do you understand it now?!? Tesla will soon supplant battery for hydrogen power, probably to be announced on Battery Day!  This picture was Musk signaling decades ago that he will be our pay pal, giving money to us buddies who crack the codes he leaves for us!

Time to write some Tesla Calls
This is what a Tesla investor looks like
Lmaoo nah bro, swing trade from amazon to Tesla. This week, don’t know why thought let’s do shop. It had good news surrounding it to but Lost most this week on shop. It is what it is Lmaoo 😂
So, my day trades were capped off because I made 4th trade on the the week following July 4th. I forgot that its five TRADING days, rather than business days. This made me pdt marked, so I lost my 3 trades a week.Fast forward to yesterday, I was jacked to the tits in spy puts, I bought them at open Thursday, wanted to lock in profits. Had a bunch of spreads opened to try to hedge profits, but decided I wanted to just cash out, so I day traded, locked my account.Once you lock you account, you have the remainder of the day to go nuts with day trades, went through a bunch of Tesla Spreads, Spy contracts and racked up 30+ trades in a day to cap off my robinhood journey.I’d assume the spreads make it look like I traded an insane amount, so realistically I probably need to deposit $3000ish-$5000. No wonder that kid killed himself, robinhood is fucking terrible. I have accts with tasty, and tos so just gonna transfer my funds into tos for the 90 day period.UPDATE: Sarah from robinhood just email’d me, I have an actual day trade call amount of $3,125.So yeah. Fuck robinhood
You see, there's a major difference between companies like Tesla getting special funding, and places like The Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts getting special funding.The difference is: I own zero shares of The Kennedy Center. Therefore it's crony capitalism to fund them.
Still can't believe that guy blew 100k on Tesla without knowing what IV is lmfao
Imagine being that guy that thought Tesla would go to $2k today. Haha. That's me. I'm that guy.
Tesla infinity squeeze is still coming though right guys? Guys? User named TSLA made a long DD with words and numbers like separate retardation did, he has to be right..?
IV Crush Explained:  Based on the state of the current market as a whole, and the state of the stock in question, the stock will have a certain % of Implied Volatility.  For example, if the IV is 40%, this means that a year from today, the market expects that the current stock price will either be 40% higher than it is today, or 40% lower than it is today.  That's why IV was very high for stocks during Coronavirus, because the market was volatile and nobody really knew what was gonna happen, so there was a chance for stock prices to move drastically either up or down.  About a couple of weeks or a month before the earnings of a stock, people start talking about how the company will perform on their earnings report. If everything has been chugging along normally, their Implied Volatility stays pretty low since nobody expects there to be a huge move in either direction.  Now in the case of Tesla, which is a meme stock (basically incredibly popular and in the news all the time), there are drastically varying opinions. Some people believe they will fail their earnings for Q2 and the stock will crash down to 1000 or less points.   Some people believe they will succeed and the stock price will jump to 2000 points.  Because of these drastically varying opinions and controversy, the Implied Volatility goes up.   Because IV goes up, more people buy into the stock thinking they could earn some nice tendies. This increases the demand for options, which in turn raises the premium fee of buying those options.  The demand and premium price stays high right up until earnings, since people are expecting a huge move in the stock price. As soon as the earnings gets released, everyone knows the truth and they know if they were wrong or right. The stock price changes quickly in after earnings trading to reflect the earnings report.  This instantly crushes the Implied Volatility since nobody expects the price the move drastically anymore, and this GREATLY reduces the premium price of the option you own, so you lost all of that extra value due to increased demand.   On top of that, your option expires tomorrow and the extrinsic value of your option decayed over time. Tomorrow, the extrinsic value will be worthless, so all you will be left with is the difference in stock price and your strike price. If you're not above break even, you basically lost all of your money.
I’m sorry why are you surprised that a typical Tesla fomo tard doesn’t know what IV is
I love the news: “US futures higher after solid earnings report for Tesla”It’s like they have no fucking clue why futures are up and just pick a random thing to say “This. This is why futures are up!”
Hi, please stop spreading misinformation. They have a fully integrated business model. Their factory in Ulm which has only ever produced fire trucks will make handcrafted beautiful trucks. They will also add an assembly line to build the trucks automatically when workers get tired of hand-building and wants some rest. Their factory in the U.S. will further integrate their business in conjunction with Ulm factory. They're focused on high margin low production models like Trucks, similar to what Tesla did, but also making jet skis and pick up trucks to make more money. You might not have a big brain like me so I showed you my research. Also Trevor is out Elonning Elon so you can't just comprehend his business model. P.s. You're speaking to the next Warren Buffet so make sure you're thankful for your free financial educaytion. I'll be going back to investing my allowance because my $500 net worth isn't going to magically double itself.
national parks are where the gay bears hang out.  watching them with ur sweet gains on tesla in a tesla from being a purebread taurus is beyond meta.ur a national treasure
They sold a fck ton of Credits, The Eu made a law that car companies that restricts emissions and you need about 15% of your cars to be close to 0 emission. But if you dont have enough and an other car company is far below that level of emission. You can buy the credits of the competitor. The fines that you get are in the billions of dollars. And tesla has 100% of its cars on 0% emission. So they can sell there credits for millions of dollars. Elon just burned taught his credits for the year so he could get s&ampp inclusion. Its just a short term boost, So his stock prices go sky high and he can raise a ton of money to build 10 more factories.
I could have bought a Model 3 instead of my $35k losses on Tesla puts.

Post this with crying baby photoshop if Tesla stays flat after earnings
Leo is then immediately hired by Tesla
Watching all the new kids that jumped into Tesla dealing and coping with it being a volatile stock is both entertaining and annoying.
There are currently 10 yr and 5 year bonds being put on the market. I think it’s 40b yesterday, 40b today, 20b Wednesday and 20b on Thursday. The market is gonna blow. Don’t be surprised by 5-10% gains in different stocks prior to their earnings release. If they gain 20% in 3 days prior to their eps, what is a 10% loss after earnings release?     For perspective: the EU approved a 750B bailout, and people are suddenly bullish on European stock. The bond sales equate to 17% of what the EU is giving to all of their members, except the 120b usd is going straight into the stock market. Those new bonds will be a delicious day trade, as will spy calls, qqq calls, tqqq calls, and travel calls. Don’t be surprised if Tesla beats eps expectations. Remember Luckin Coffee? Elon has enough money to pay someone else to take the blame for accounting mistakes.
Congrats on having 300 dollars. Should be good for maybe a 7/24 Tesla 3000c
I go poop for 5 minutes and I come back and Tesla is up wtf
so this is why tesla is so fucking choppy
Tesla stock price is too flat imo.
Lose it all on some dumb ass calls that I shouldnt be making. Already down to 5.5k in my account😉, currently in azn 65c for 21/8 though, should be good. May also go all out on tesla 3500c 24/7 for earnings yolo

&gtthat the stock market is in a bubbleI can't believe this would be a speculative position. Tesla is worth $1500/share and has never shown the ability to be profitable. Nikola doesn't even have a product, they have $0.00 REVENUE, and their cap quadrupled after IPO. The market was always out of sync with reality, but recently it has become completely detached.
It would be so much fun to watch Tesla drop below 1k. The sheer despair of this sub would be delicious.
You guys should be thanking me for not touching Tesla. I refuse to trade it. I know the second I’d grab it it would tank.So I won’t touch it. I see it rocketing to the moon every day. And I will see you everyday posting obscene gains. One of the biggest upward rallies in history. You’re welcome.
God I wish I had the balls and the capital to play Tesla
Nikola Tesla must be very proud about this Nio generation of cars. But sadly he’s dead.
I always knew it'd end this way for Tesla, a standoff against federal agents in Alameda
Here is what's happening. He is aligning himself with the type of people who are against the idea of electric cars. Tesla trucks will go from being a purchase for environmentally conscious, forward thinking individuals to being a symbol of rebellion, questioning the government, and badassery. Sales will skyrocket in rural areas and custom full body wraps with the confederate flag will be common.
replacing f150s with tesla cybertruck
Thisbguy would rather put the well being of himself, kid kid, his wife , and his employees then disappoint his share holders. Makes me wanna buy a Tesla call
It's easy to predict Tesla moves. Just think, "How do the Musk worshipers feel about it?" Threatening to move Tesla is financially stupid and illogical but the Tesla gang loves this move. Because it's Musk sticking it to those corrupt assholes running California who are only interested in lining their pockets with healthy citizens.
And this is how Tesla made a logo
The market is flocking to safe haven stocks like Tesla and GameStop
Of course Tesla is worth more now that they’re not making cars.
I see you're new here. Why don't you take a seat in the corner and let me tell you a story about Papa Elon and his great Tesla roller coaster.
Today was rough man. I've posted about this before but it's been a real mental struggle. Made 20 grand long on Tesla shares and then Tesla puts end of day today on some quick whatever trades.  And then one of my covid patients died. It was expected, but sad. Family couldn't come in because they were quarantined and our unit is isolated bc of being a covid unit and so I went into his iso room so he wouldn't die alone. I stood there as I put him on comfort measures and watched him die in front of me and almost broke down. It's been so depressing watching these intensive care covid patients die one after the other. No one has survived intubation yet. I understand Italy. It's depressing. Yeah it's cool making money. I've doubled my yearly resident salary in two weeks. But my heart is fucking broken and crying out to these people and their families and we're trying so hard to find a cure that I would literally undo those trades in a second to even save one of them. Just one. This will get lost in the wsb thread, I know. Just needed to share.  But it's been a hard day and I'm up again in 5 hours for another 18 hour day watching people die and trying new therapies. Wsb makes me smile on my few min that I take for myself during the day. It has for 5 years and still does now. Love you guys. Stay safe.
Parents died from a Tesla crash
We going MSFT calls now. Tesla was so January. February is a different beast
Wsbgod was a an ARK invest pump shill. ARK is saying Tesla will generate $350+ billion revenue from Robo-Taxis in 4 years, I mean common I am retarded but even I don’t buy that
If your total empire generates 30 billion why suicide over 550 million? Trump lost 600 million in one year and now look at him, the president of the United States. Another investor, Baron who owned Tesla stock at $3 sold it. Baron also lost around 250 million after a CEO was indicted for price fixing. Baron now owns one of the largest hedge funds in the world. Even if this guy lost 1 billion it shouldn’t have sunk his empire? What am I missing?
TESLA TRAIN GANG
Buy your Tesla coffee thermos now. Because by 2020 all Tesla coffee thermos’ will receive a software update making them capable of full self brewing and we plan to have a billion thermos’ worldwide. These thermos’ will appreciate in value, as it can generate revenue for their owners. It would be foolish to buy any thermos besides a Tesla thermos.
Tesla.Why?  Because you should always be buying Tesla.
A tesla employee actually just stole source code from tesla and sent it to chinese company Xiaopeng. BABA backed??? anyway crazy shit china/tesla rn.&amp#x200B[https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20689468/tesla-autopilot-trade-secret-theft-guangzhi-cao-xpeng-xiaopeng-motors-lawsuit-filing](https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/10/20689468/tesla-autopilot-trade-secret-theft-guangzhi-cao-xpeng-xiaopeng-motors-lawsuit-filing)
I can confirm this. I've been visiting the city of Irvine for a few months now (city in Orange County, south of Los Angeles). All you see are Chinese people driving Teslas. And I'm not exaggerating. Maybe 5 out of 10 cars are Chinese people driving a Tesla. Non-racists side note: I've never seen an accident. You gotta assume the AI is working well.
This guy trades^. I’m on trade 1 with Tesla at 360, only a few trades away from a million. I’ll buy gold for everyone that upvotes this when I become a millionaire
I’m reading this thread while my Tesla drives me. Long Papa Musk.
except hes actually an upset tesla bear
TIL I’m a fucking idiot for being a Tesla bull because of animals like this.
He’s obviously doing it to help Elon take Tesla private.
Short Tesla
Counterpoint: You can see Apple's selling of the iPhone as being nothing unique, it's just another phone right? Tesla is the major electric car brand, and a premium one at that. People WANT Teslas, it invokes an emotion for a lot of people when they first get in one or see one, much like Apple products. I truly see a future in which Tesla is the only electric car company making a lot of money, and all others are just scraping by and chasing Tesla like the phone manufacturers who never quite caught up with the iPhone's popularity.&amp#x200BObviously very different industries and companies, etc, but I think the comparison is interesting nonetheless.
Elon needs to get over his Tesla arrogance on two fronts ASAP.Take his competition seriously. Tesla is not in fact doing anything unique. They need to start contrasting themselves with other EV makers, not positioning themselves as THE saviours of the planet.Take his marketing seriously. The company needs to do a lot more than lean on Elon’s twitter account.
Math backs up your Tesla bull post
Also Musk owns 22% of Tesla and 54% of SpaceX
&gt **I find that in the past, everything I've been obsessed with has turned into incredibly profitable businesses.**  The fundamental analysis that I came here for. Tesla will have to transition to subscription based software soon, one time cost won't do it. Analyst will love this (look at MS/Adobe, constant predictable revenue streams). Once subscriptions are implemented, figuring out a way to tie them in with an auto loan will be next step. EX. Buy a Tesla and get the base software support for 7 years (avg time someone owns their car). Then a 1 year package of subscription based software for free with the option at purchase to buy an additional 4 years @ 15% reduction price or something like this. The "Pre-order" bonus of future software with the purchase of this package will draw revenue in as long as it is cost prohibitive. Tesla has to build an ecosystem around these cars but that will take revenue. Why Elon would go the route of insurance is beyond me as Tesla doesn't have the network or infrastructure built for this. Why analyst thought that was a good idea is beyond me.
*sees Tesla hoodie* Time to buy the dip
You actually didn’t do any DD on their financials. You forget that once they sell a car, that’s all the money they get from that purchase. In fact, from there, they have to service the car under warranty.  So yeah they’ve sold a bunch of cars, but all the money they made from those is gone. And they’re in debt, in fact. And if these cars are supposed to last a million miles, do you really think people are going to buy a new one every 3-5 years?  Even Apple is having trouble getting people to upgrade after the 6S because it’s such a solid phone. I mean I like Tesla, and I own a Model S, but the stock just makes no sense. Now, if they can strike deals with home builders to put a Tesla roof and Powerwall in every new home, then we’re talking real money bc it’s supposed to cost the same as a normal roof. Bonus points if they can convince local governments that every new home MUST have a solar roof. I believe somewhere in California has this law now.
But why? A Tesla is cheaper these days
Futures slammed through the 200 MA, I have a feeling my short Tesla x10 position I bought yesterday will benefit
haupt91 would be rich if he could bring himself to direct his talent at something that wasn't a waste of time.At the last Tesla 52 week high 10 months ago, up in the 350's haupt91 made this: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/8wa29p/tesla_just_buy_it/So could this be writing on the wall that we're finally at Tesla super-bottom ground floor?
I literally just bought Tesla calls, then came to WSB and saw this.  I am elmo :(
I don't know which one of you to believe.Better buy some Tesla stock
Does the porn shot in the self driving tesla fit into that filming budget?
Tesla website, graphics, copywrites and their filming will be filed under marketing and advertising.
Well Tesla has been going down and down absolutely no relief rally or anything may be a slow motion crash
Wake up for work late, as usual. Grabbing my phone half wondering if there's time to jerk off and half hoping Tesla tanked more. It did, I rejoice in the moment before going to kill time at the office. *heh, these financially retarded coworkers have no idea I'm such a goddamn stock genius.* I say grinning to myself, pretending the +12% day means anything against my -80% all-time. I check back after the morning meeting. +20% and rising. I go back to pretending to do work. It starts tanking at 3pm musk tweets out "👌". In my sweat and panic, I try to sell. Robinhood doesnt fill. I keep reentering as my puts plummet lower, taking break even at this point. I end up losing $700 as TSLA closes flat for the day, a final fuck you to make it look like nothing even happened.Then I do it all over again the next day.
This is the biggest reason I won't buy a Tesla right now, despite the cars themselves being attractive at ~$40k to me. It wouldn't be the first time this has happened to a car company where the consumer ended up with very little means of support or very expensive service afterwards. It would be massively compounded by the fact that other companies can't produce a lot of the parts or drive software updates. If Tesla goes under cost of maintenance for the existing cars is going to skyrocket.
&gt He sees a 40% chance (up from 35%) of a “full bear” scenario of $36, a 55% chance of a “moderate bull” scenario of $253 and a 5% chance (down from 10%) of a “full bull case” of $760.Headline could've just as easily been "Citi sees chance that Tesla goes to $760".
Tesla is indeed a company
I also forsee Tesla either going up, or (and this is pretty wild) going down.
There is a Tesla Motors pornhub account and it’s verified
Tight. Does this channel have videos of Tesla fucking it’s investors?
The other 50% is Tesla calls
So the new sales strategy for Tesla is to get 10 year olds to buy Model 3s with their parents’ credit card? 🤔 I mean it’s not the dumbest idea they’ve ever had...
She would probably do a PornHub Tesla video with one of you autists if you asked nicely.
Maybe trow in some  Tesla stock aswell, with Musk fantastic "robot taxis plan" what can go wrong . With diversifying in Uber, Lyft and Tesla there is no way this can go tits up in anypossible way.

Hmmm Tesla accounting
Looks like Elon has stopped posting on his own twitter and started posting on the Tesla official twitter
jeeze, imagine if Musk pulls it off by turning Tesla into the next Amazon. Just imagine how retarded future CEOs will be then.
SEC don't care. They have important things to worry about like Elon tweeting publicly available information about Tesla.
Tesla stocks convert money into memes and Im alright with that
tesla model 3 performance
I invest in Tesla, so I must have autism
Tesla is just a small young start up that’s worth more than F.
Thats tesla fucking its competition
"I'll bet you $5000 that Tesla won't go bankrupt this month.""Ok, but if they do you'll owe me $1,000,000"*shakes hands*
Turns out you can do great things when your CEO isn't a fuckn asshole (are you listening FB Uber Tesla?)
Tesla is an easy stock to watch you buy when in plunges and the Elon will meme gradually, increasing the stock, Then when he starts to turbo meme, you know it's about to crash
BAC beats earnings, stock crashes. Tesla misses earnings by 300%, stock moons. What a world.
If that isn't a reason to long tesla, I don't know what is
For the record, I like him... it just seems that when he's talking Tesla, that extra chromosome kicks in.
*owner on Tesla app:*  pre heat vehicle. *Tesla vehicle* I will exceed owners expectations.
The SEC and Tesla 😂
his Twitter is lowkey gibberish ranting but it doesn’t have to do with Tesla!
Investing 1m on Tesla using robinhood. You sir belong here
Man I remember watching that live... cringe when he had to explain bear sterns joke. Social skills of the ultimate nerd. But long Tesla and Elon. 
SEC are a bunch of goons. Take Tesla private Papa.

My professor just stated that Apple will buy Tesla. Thinking about dropping that class
Tesla is down 10% pre-market this guy is as good as banned. 
It is similar to Tesla but with no plan to actually make money.

&gt”Tell us about a time you used outside the box thinking to solve a difficult problem”“I really wanted a Tesla but I blew all my savings on $MU calls so I made a fake resume and bullshitted my way into an interview with an investment firm. When they hire me, I’ll make enough to buy a Tesla.”
During the negotiation set a high salary then lower it to their acceptable range and ask for a Tesla on the side for taking the lower salary.
Reminds me of the guy from last week who sold a shit ton of puts or something (hundreds of thousands of $ risk) because there is “literally no way” that Tesla drops below $300. It dropped below $300 like 2 days later. Currently $297. 
I'm guilty of adding Tesla as well... cant go tits up.  Right?
Every company In the world coining the term Tesla killer 
guys, if my Tesla calls hit ITM, I will buy you all a trip to Cancun. &amp#x200B
Who else read half way through only to go “how does this have anything to do with Tesla?”
I did the math, if tesla hits 4000$ a share I’ll be a millionaire 
Positions were mostly SPY, amazon, and Tesla.  Went 80k+ worth of contract a time and just traded with the trend. Followed the +30%/-20% rule and stuck with it! Edit: Also, just to clarify this is not me. This is my boss who I introduced to options. He started with a capital of 19k a month ago and ultimately reached 25k last Friday. Starting this week off with 25k he reached 180k just following the trend. He doesn’t read charts or follow/understand support and resistance levels. Each trade he does, he maxes it out, meaning he puts his entire portfolio into ONE option and buys the most he can and exits based on +30%/-20%. TLDR: 25k to 190k in a week following trends.

One day I was out drunk at a bar and saw a Tesla, I thought about you and shaked the owners hand told him he just saved a faggots life, he told me to get away from him but I did it in your honor since I’ve been with you since the beggining
Hmmm I see what you are saying, buy Tesla January calls. 
Either get in line or fuck off. Daddy Elon is taking us Tesla Babies to Mars. Deal with it. *Slobs on elon's massive manhood.*🍆💦💦💦
I went from 1700 to 32k.  Bought a model s tesla.  Then lost 50k for a net negative of 20k. AFTER I BOUGHT THE TESLA.  WITHOUT CASHING OUT.  FUCKING WITH OPTIONS.   All in 3 months. but I've got a tesla.  It's a model s with autopilot do I can sleep while I drive between my soon to be 3 jobs making up for my losses.Now, That's how you WSB.  
Tesla shorts on suicide watch.
Hey guys,&amp#x200BSo the reason I went with this large play was because of this guys Twitter. He’s predicted TESLA, HD, SQ, WYNN earnings correctly[https://twitter.com/askslim](https://twitter.com/askslim)&amp#x200BAdditionally I read this every morning[http://www.1option.com/index.php?/global/comments/market\_will\_drop\_until\_g20\_bears\_dodged\_2\_bullets\_overnight/](http://www.1option.com/index.php?/global/comments/market_will_drop_until_g20_bears_dodged_2_bullets_overnight/)&amp#x200B
Tesla calls.
Lmao bmw, reliable. My friend had his Tesla for over 2 weeks and no problems. That itself proves Tesla’s reliability over bmw 
Top of the peak was selling baba after earnings. After that went all in AMAT ER which tanked 10% the next day. Then started to play MU. I went all in on margin at like $57 hoping for a day bounce to $60 again. The next day MU falls off a cliff for no reason and loses like 10%. I then bag hold and pray it goes up for months. Average down with everything I can the whole time. Get to like $55 average but can never dent the all in like 228k first cost basis. Finally sell at around $43 something. Realized loss of 78k+ I think. Hardest thing I’ve ever done. I then use what I had left and bought into Tesla when it hit $256. Used RH gold to go all in and change average to $252. Held though earnings based on tweets and saying longs will be fine and company email saying profit soon. Figured it was a safe bet for some small gains from bottom. Sold all stock at $344 on Monday. One trade, stock only, made up the months of MU bullshit. I wanted to post to give others hope. Losing feels like shit and realized losses are hard as fuck. But you can some day get back out of the hole. 
Ima go to a Tesla showroom and jack off in a model s daddy.
I found proof that op is actually elon musk: 1 year ago he wrote a post about overwatch and mentioned "Tesla" in it!
No, it all started when that 1 Tesla burned and the world went ape shit. He figured he's dealing with a bunch of sub 100 IQ retards might as well enjoy himself while he's at it. Instead of stressing over the fact of trying to satisfy a bunch of monkeys.
Tesla is a car company?

Nice dude. I had Tesla calls worth $400 and held for 2 weeks and they were $50 yesterday. Woke up to see it’s worth $1100! Roller coaster of emotions lol

I honestly want tesla to crash and burn just to see reddit shit itself in rage.
I understand the shorts are very vocal about Tesla, but Musk is just so arrogant and butthurt.  People have been heavily shorting AMD for years, trash AMD whenever NVIDIA or Intel products are compared to AMDs, yet you don't see Su Bae bitching on Twitter.
I'm shorting Tesla because it feels good to know someone always has me in their thoughts
They said the T word&gtThose trade tensions have resulted in an import tariff rate of 40% on Tesla vehicles versus 15% for other imported cars in China.
Tesla could be a worthless company by 2020 says random internet user
"thinking of taking tesla private at $420 per share. _Funding secured_"He hadn't actually secured funding, some saudis had approached him saying Elon should take Tesla private, and then Elon went ahead and annouced without actually checking with the Saudis how much they would chip in and what their target price was. 
How is this and the followup wrong comment so upvoted? It was [clearly reported](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/28/business/elon-musk-tesla-sec-deal.html) that the original settlement deal allowed him to stay on as CEO and also not admit guilt. It was the complaint filed after he rejected the original settlement which asked to remove him as CEO.
This whole fiasco just proves to me Musk is a blast to be around when he's drinking not in a partying kind of way either.edit: I mean can you imagine Musk swinging a whiskey glass around "I'm taking Tesla private at $420. Funding secured." 
I did the math and assuming the shares of the company don’t change, Tesla would have to have a market cap of a little over $500 Billion or about a third of the global automotive market. He’s like that ARK ETF CEO, just drinking the Kool-Aid
I cant wait for it to bounce back to $280 Monday and see what video he post.Then he will buy back in, the SEC will announce it is suing Tesla itself, and then he buys $rope as it drills below $260.
Tesla tweet: "It is with great regret and sadness that I must report that TSLA will be taken private at $269.99.  All public investors will be forced out at this number, otherwise forfeiting their ownership.  Funding for the transaction come from three places, Musk's personal savings, Tesla Savings, and a number of unnamed investors".  Edit: Wew this blew up, Comment hijack text follows:The indictment conflates Musk's tweet that morning with the fact that Bin Salman, 2 hours later used his father's Saudi Arabian petrol dollars to purchase 2.1 billion USD worth of $TSLA at the market, pressuring the stock 2 hours later. The stock was trending down before the Saudis bid up the asking price. The one person worldwide who has the greatest legitimate claim on being deceived by Musk's rogue tweets is Bin Salman of Saudi Arabia.  Maybe we can get him in here for an AmA.Here's a info graphic illustrating the distinct separation between the events and another times article also found conflating the events (corporate owned Fake news): https://i.imgur.com/NzMb2L4.pngIn the graphic, the table in the lower right shows the tweet time juxtaposed with the 2 billion Saudi purchase. Bin Salman was deceived! He bought at 375 expecting $420, but got $270 instead.  The indictment would have you believe that Musk had a guilty conscience when tweeting, to launch his stock to $520 with a dishonest tweet, but the reality shows it's more likely that the Saudis based their decision on private talks, not on the tweet.  Therefore the tweet has provably nothing to do with the 11% gain that day.  Worse, this graphic proves Bin Salman or his representatives were insider trading that week.  This appears to be him caught red handed doing public trading on information that nobody else could know.  The SEC should be getting to the bottom of this.  But instead: Salman for his connection to insider trading, and the more general problem of foreign wealthy citizens colluding to profit from the American economy while not having to obey its laws: https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/78j
Musk and Tesla have money, but they don't have anything close to Intel's "fuck the rules, I have money" money.
Just like that time he stuffed a dead hooker in the trunk of a Tesla, then shot it into space.
Whatever happened to that guy who took out a few hundred thousand dollar loan for Tesla stock back when Musk announced he was going private? He dead?
Did you not see Teslas CEO call a Thai Cave diver hero a pedophile, and say "Funding Secured".And you're wondering why Tesla doesn't have D&ampO coverage.I'd be more surprised if they did.
Laugh. It's gonna be a great day. Tesla memes, that bio play that seems like half the subreddit went in on, more fb chaos and you know Trump has to say something before the weekend.It's all going to be fucking hilarious and I can't wait. 
Overheard in Tesla board room after Game 7:“They got me,” Elon said of the SEC dunk over him. "That f***ing agency boomed me."Elon added, “They’re so good,” repeating it four times.Elon then said he wanted to add MU to the list of puts he buys this summer.
He might be disbarred from being an officer of a publicly traded company. That might actually be good for Tesla...
Tesla doesn't have Directors and Officers insurance, so all the officers and directors are going to have to pay out of pocket for this (or company could pay). Even more cash burn.
I told u guys that Tesla is a religion , so these guys just going to church to help.
Calls are a type of options: contracts to buy or sell a stock at a specified time in the future and at a specific price.People sell options contracts for flat fees. Ideally, if you sell options, all your options will expire without being used, because they are worthless, and you just keep the fee, while the person who bought the options does nothing and loses their money. So if you have a bunch of Tesla stock, you can sell options on that stock to people. Let's say you sell an option contract on Tesla for $50. That contract gives the buyer the right to buy some of your Tesla stock at a given price. Let's say $350 on November 15. Right now, Tesla is trading well below that, so the seller of those options thinks he can just pocket the $50. Who would overpay that much to own the stock? But wait, Musk unveils a secret Tesla plant on the moon and begins delivering cars via reusuable rockets, bam the stock skyrockets to $400.Suddenly, it's November 13, two days before the contract expires, and the stock is worth $400, but the buyer has a contract saying they can buy a whole bunch of it for $350/share, giving them an instant profit of $50/share for as many shares as the contract specifies. Turns out, the contract itself is quite valuable now. You bought it for $50 because the seller thought "ain't no way in hell the stock is going up that much, lemme grab some easy money from suckers". You can sell your contract at a massive profit over the $50 you paid for it. Calls are bets that a stock will rise. Puts are slightly different bets that a stock will fall, but they follow the same basic structure and idea.These are just easy round numbers, I'm pretty sure $TSLA calls are way more expensive than $50.
My nigga. Have fun with the new Tesla and vacation in the tropics. Don’t forget to wrap ur willy while banging those escorts. 
"Tesla is said to face US Criminal Probe over Musk Statements"Lol.
This is good for Tesla.
Next step: Get Tyson, Musk and Joe Rogan to do a podcast in a Tesla model 3 in space with weed, you know for the advancement of society 
The odd thing is, Nikola Tesla himself was an truly a genius and visionary, but died pretty much penniless. Edison was an enemy, constantly pushing his inefficient DC power plants vs. Tesla’s AC power plants.
Camera pans down to the sweaty back of Elon (obviously showing a full head of hair) as he fires the remaining fuel from his flamethrower into a horde of pedo-zombies.  He saves the drunk co-eds from the cave with his huge submarine and he says "Who wants to take a ride on this roadster?", only to show a Tesla shaped codpiece as he uses the flame from a dead pedo to blaze a blunt
- Makes 35k in a day playing Tesla.- Has notifications about a biotech penny stock.Seems legit.

wow. you actually did it. you shorted tsla enough to buy a tesla. You going for 2 teslas? whats your target?

I totally would but he blocked my number after I recommended that he let everything else go and start a weed company.  I keep telling him, Elon my dude, you know they are just going to open up weed bars once this thing kicks into high gear.  Let's sell all of this gay Tesla shit and just double down with some cat cafe/weed bars.  I even offered to help him find some cats. 
I'm sorry, I can't be reading this right. You have call options for Tesla at $600? Are you smoking drugs? 
To be fair, if you zoom in on Amazon circa 1999 it would look like Tesla.
Thank you Elon! The stock market would miss out on too much drama with Tesla going private. No short shorts, no lsd tweets, no funding secured, no funny pedo comments. It would be a loss in meme material for everyone. 
All i can think of is the dude who borrowed $200k+ to buy Tesla shares waiting for the $420 buyout
Understatement of the century. Musk is Tesla, the same for SpaceX. You lose Musk, the allure of the brand goes with him.
you kind of let me down a little by not getting through their security checks and getting onto the show and then screaming "Tesla $420 fuck pedos" but you did good
Talked to producers like 5 times before they let me on. They Had to make sure I wasn’t gonna scream “Tesla $420” on a national media outlet. Surely market manipulation like that would lead to serious fines and/or jail time. 
When Tesla goes up, you gotta smash it back down
Wow, how did you get this candid shot from the last Tesla board meeting?
Wheres the guy who sold his house or some shit to buy Tesla shares at 365

They dont like it but will follow elon wherever he goesedit: looks more like they're hoping the saudi stuff will just provide a backbone/leverage for tesla to get nonsaudi funding. they dont like saudi involvement at all. many comments talking how they would vote no to saudi funded deal although they want tesla private
I would buy a pair of Tesla shorts if the emblem was right on the crotch not on a leg
Someone explain the tesla logo to me. Is it a tee shirt with a line over it?
Musk under investigation for security fraud. Tesla declares bankrupty. Up 19% after hours.

YoHis Tesla production linemen are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy There's vomit on his sweater already, cucked by Martin ShkreliHe's nervous, but on the social he sounds calm and ready To drop Twitter bombs, but he keeps on forgettin' What his lawyer wrote down, the whole SEC goes so loud He opens his mouth, indictable words come out He's chokin', how, everybody's jokin' now The stocks run out, funds up, over, blaow!
Pretty sure thats not going to happen. If there is funding available for $420 / share but Tesla only offers $380 / share then I'll be joining the class action lawsuit.
Now imagine if Tesla changes the buyout price to 380 per share. 
So you're betting that Tesla shareholders will approve of the biggest leveraged buyout in history, and that Musk does indeed have the proper funding to do it, and that it'll happen fairly quickly? I honestly hope this is fake.
I bought in around $21 in November 2010 after reading a Wired article about Musk and how he put in his last thousand dollars to keep the company afloat, before the Daimler investment.  I was a poor college student but had an extra ~$400 from student loans laying around so I bought 20 shares.  I've traded these shares throughout the year and never held more than 20.  If I had been more ballsy, maybe I could afford a Tesla now! 
It's only fraud if it can be shown that Tesla never had the intent nor the ability to follow up their promise, and were publicly lying for the sake of artifically driving up the value of their own stock in order to execute a "pump and dump" scheme. So far Musk has done the pump, but so far shows no signs of dumping.
News: Elon Musk plants flag in Mars. Does Moon walk to celebrate. Reddit: I predict Tesla will be down tomorrow. That moon walk was sub par. Me: he’s fucking on mars. Reddit: it was pathetic. 
He is a mod that removes all non Tesla posts. 
If Elon takes Tesla private he better start another public company so we can all ride the musky dick again
This is the best.  420 could get here by tomorrow, in which case voters will likely shoot down the privitization offer.  So shorts get cucked, Elon did nothing wrong, and Tesla longs profit lol.
The only way $TSLA goes down is if this sub turns bullish on Tesla.
Bezos: Let's his wife to drive him around in a crappy HondaDaddy Elon: Let's his brand new Tesla drive for him while he bangs big tiddied goth girls screaming DO YOU LIKE SHORT SHORTS?!?! 
When Tesla reports an EPS of $.01 they are going to become the first $2 trillion company.
Come back win or lose please. Have the balls the 75k Tesla put guy had. 
I got some Tesla puts to sell you, my friend. 
Tech this week: Misses earnings, drops 20%.Car companies: Miss earnings, drop 10-15%.Tesla: Miss earnings, 13% up.
Tesla has a nice P/E.  Except it’s negative.
Why would you bet your life savings on something as irrational as Tesla 
Yes. Tesla is not a logical stock at all. Hell, no stocks lately are logical or predictable. If you are so confident in TSLA going down, why are you not 100% all in puts?
Idk tesla says u can ask for 10% refunds a year later
Elon: Look, our price model is fine. I reviewed the numbers myself. Over time with enough volume, we become profitable.Financial Guy: Yeah, with a fixed cost pricing model that's correct. But you need to use a variable cost pricing model.Elon: Okay, sure. Right, so-- why don't you explain what that is to-- so that they can under-- just explain what that is. Explain what you think that is.Financial Guy: As you sell more cars and your company grows, so will your costs. For example, accident settlements, recalls...At these prices, the more cars you sell, the less money you'll make.Elon: Our prices are the only thing keeping us in business.Financial Guy: They're actually putting you out of business.Elon: Okay, okay. Hold on, hold on. I would like you to crunch those numbers again.Financial Guy: It's a program. There's no such thing--Elon: Just crunch 'em. Just crunch 'em please.Financial Guy: [presses key on computer] Crunch.Tesla Longs: Did it help?
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥I'm in on Tesla stock
This is good for tesla AND children
Tesla is still a meme stock. Their business model is horrifically similar to so many early dot-coms it’s not funny, and just as those days, it’s a cult-like exuberance that keeps the stock so high. Can they “Amazon?” Maybe. But Amazon, as many other companies like them, got slaughtered in 2000 when investors started looking at fundamentals. Amazon survived that bloodletting by the skin of their teeth had that same money gone into Hardware.com or Pets.com, it would be gone. Eventually, that will happen to Tesla - the volatility of the stock reflects this is already happening to an extent. The erratic behavior of the CEO - from his talk about the “bears” manipulating the market (always the biggest red flag in my view), his jokes about being in the breadline, his continued distraction towards other projects like Mars rockets and Thai submarines, and his insistence that the numbers don’t matter mean I will never invest in Tesla. It smacks of Pseudo. It smacks of MtGox.The numbers simply don’t add up. Maybe I’m wrong. Considering what they are trying to do, I hope I am. But I am certain that one day the money spigot is going to dry up, and Tesla’s obligations will overwhelm them. The company is a Titanic taking on water. The question is really about how long he can keep convincing rich people to throw money at manning the pumps.
9 years ago I was looking at Tesla IPO but decided it was dumb. No way would I risk investing in a company that gets all their money from liberal energy loans, that doesn't even really sell their product or have a scale in which to ramp up. It takes years to do that and no way would they achieve funding while doing it along with actually having a popular product... they'd never be profitable.My roommate thought their cars were cool and I told him they'd be bankrupt in 3 years.
The founder, CEO and sole reason for Tesla being in business is gradually going insane on Twitter and it doesn't have anything to do with the stock? You must be long.
Better yet, use a Tesla.Even more impressive, the exact Tesla that was shot into space.  
This is good for Tesla.
To prove how confident he is in the engineers he should get himself stuck in a cave and have them use the Tesla sub to get him out. 
This is good for Tesla.
He was wearing his Tesla shorts
The usual way to proft of a bankruptcy is shorting it or buying puts, but it's Tesla so it might go up once they're bankrupt.
Kid at work casually mentioned that he trades on Robinhood and that he wants "to get Musky" with Tesla stocks. I just chuckled and told him that he needs to keep me updated on the reg.
every tesla engineer gets a divorce from stress so they support two families.
Musky is going to have a fully functioning submarine fleet before Tesla 3 hits production targets
No one can convince me that tesla/boring company/SpaceX has a board of directors, or a competent C-suite that can say:-listen man, we build rocket /cars /tunnels. And we have no fricking idea how too build subs. Why can't the Thai government be left alone?However i'm looking forward for the documentary about the cluster fuck. 
The fact that musk can keep tesla stock at such high levels has to count for something. How many other CEOs could keep the stock price climbing despite being unprofitable and missing all important production goals?
Meh, could not care about their profit, CEO or share price as long as they keep making cars like my model 3. The car is phenomenal. It makes me look forward to driving it every day. If reliability stays solid for the next few years I'll never buy from another manufacturer.Special thanks to Otto's BMW for sales tactics that made me walk away from a 340i and put a deposit on a Tesla.
If upvotes could pay my rent I'd be living in San Fran with some vlog fags and a Tesla. 
What does their partner needing to invest a billion of previously unplanned capital say about their fiscal situation?  That it's not great obviously...Panasonic is likely using the infusion as a way to gain additional control/ownership over the production facilities which could signal that they're ultimately looking to reduce the scope of their partnership with tesla(given tesla's issues with cashflow and their need to probably access capital markets again within 12 months it would make sense that Panasonic may be considering other options for the plants that have a better ROI).  That's pretty huge news that's being discussed quite a bit in the real world but literally everyone in a tesla thread online is borderline retarded and can only focus on jerking off over how many cars were actually produced in a week, which is largely irrelevant. 
Does Tesla have a problem with overproduction?
Please visit dick riding central r/teslamotors if you ever want to see a cult in action. I am subscribed to that place so that I don’t get left out of the action when Tesla files chap 11 and the subreddit goes private.So few weeks back when Enron Musk tweeted the tent, the cunt cult there bashed the media for calling the structure a “tent” , later when musk himself started calling it a tent then all the fanboys ate up his goo and said a tent is fine and they trust Elon musk with QAEnjoy https://www.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/8rtwmz/elons_final_warning_shorts_have_3_weeks_before/Great advise from that thread —-   “ *Dude, with 122 shares don't sell them for a car. Even though model 3 is like a blowjob on wheels. Sit on those shares for 10 years. Elons comp package indicates those shares could be worth $2-4k in 10 years. DO NOT SELL for a 50k car* ”
This is good for Tesla.
Tesla has never been rational. What’s better a company that currently makes 10 bil or a company that could make 10 bil? Sums up F vs tesla
They’re jealous that Tesla benefits from double standards that actual companies could never get away with 
You never buy the shares. You just sell them, which opens up your exposure to Tesla. You have to “close out” the short position by buying Tesla stock back. If you sell 10 shares short, you have -10 shares. If the price goes up, you have to buy those -10 shares back to get back to 0 shares, but at a higher price. You sold lower than you bought for, thus resulting in a loss.Shorting is kinda stupid af cause the stock can only go to 0, which caps the profit you can make from it. (Sell for $300, buy for $0 = $300 profit) But it can go up indefinitely, meaning your risk exposure is unlimited.
Shorted Tesla and then posted desperate memes on Reddit
The tweets of a million Tesla fanboys will blot out the sun.

I will probably never buy Tesla shares but if you don’t want this man to succeed you are unamerican
"Tesla has achieved break-even on tours segment stock up 25% AH
If we’re being honest, that’s probably what it is costing Tesla too
Was that a Tesla that hit him?!?!?!?! SHOOOOORRRRRRRTTTTTTTT!!!! INSIDE JOB 
Short squeeze to 500 then print more stock. Shorts basically financing Tesla dream.Elon is a genius
Aight. Buying tesla calls
Elon just wants to stand on Mars in his Tesla pod vehicle while it carries him towards the summit of Mount Olympus. Meanwhile he watches another SpaceX  BFR touch down softly in the Martian dust in the distance. His Neural net allows him to see a diagram under the surface showing the progress of his Boring company machines building housing tunnels via AI control.  Sparkling everywhere are fields of Tesla solar panels that are providing electricity for the rapidly expanding colony. He then looks out towards where the shining dot that is Earth in the sky and whispers to himself, “I told you so.”Then he shifts his gaze farther out into the stars, takes one last deep breathe of recycled air, and beams back to the future. The history of humanity changed and his mission completed.But some people want to short one of his companies, and that’s cool too.

Where does Elon even get cash like that? I thought he was borrowing against his Tesla equity already?
If the shareholders vote Elon out they are actually fucking retarded.People invest in Elon not Tesla. 
Jokes aside... at our day and age perhaps we’ll see negative dividends for the privilege of owning Tesla. 
Tesla isn't a nonprofit by choice.
And tesla is one of them
They hired Snap’s VP of monetization? Snap loses almost as much money as Tesla.
I'll give this a shot and try fighting autism with more autism.&gt around 40% of their cash in hand is from refundable deposits, from people who thought they would get a $35k carMost of these people are still keeping their deposits and waiting for the car&gt Tesla cannot make $35k M3s at a profit(this is widely accepted, and even Tesla hinted at it), they'll lose money even making $42k cars. They need to make $50k cars to earn a decent profitThey can't make a profit on the 35k version *today* but they will be able to sometime in the future. &gtWhen asked in the earning call last week about reservations and how many people chose to cancel/take up their car once offered, Musk stunningly called the question "boring" and "boneheaded" and went on take questions from a youtuber for 20 mins. This was considered unprecedented and bizarre and stock dove. I agree this was a bad move on his part, and he sort of apologized for it, but to be fair he's said in the past that he doesn't answer questions regarding reservations since the media will take it and post some $fakenews articles about it.  &gtTesla is losing about 800-900 million a quarter, so they will run out of money without a cash infusion. Literally everyone knows that Tesla will need to raise capital this year.*at the current production rateOnce they reach a production rate of 4-5k (which they're on track to hit in June) they'll be cash flow positive. They spent so much on Capital Infrastructure that they're not taking advantage of with a production rate of 2k that once they hit that 5k mark their costs will only go up a fraction of the amount that their revenues will increase, thus greatly increasing FCFTaking a quick autism break, I'll be back to continue disproving why Tesla is going to the moon after I take my autism pills&gt Musk though, has insisted that Tesla will not need to raise cash because they will be "profitable by Q3 or Q4". Reminder that they lost 780 million in Q1, and even small profits won't be enough to prevent running out of cash. In order to make profits they need to sell 10,000 cars a week. They were supposed to produce 5000 cars a week in 2017. They have just now been able to produce 2500/week.See my previous point. Also there was a leaked email that they made 3500/week last week so there's that. Some quick math shows that at their estimated 20% margin for the quarter and at 5000 cars per week that will mean they produce 13*5000 cars or 65000 cars. At an average selling price of 55k (let's use 50k to be conservative) that's 65,000*$50,000 = $3,250,000,000 in revenue. At a margin of 20% that's $650,000,000 in cash flow from the model 3's. Maybe not yet positive in Q3 but it will massively reduce their negative cash flow to close to 0.&gtEven bulls say that Musk is bluffing and he will eventually raise cash this year. Moody's downgrade of Tesla to essentially junk stocks makes it harder to raise cash at good interest rates. Moreover, there is speculation and some evidence that the reason Tesla haven't already done so, is that they are under SEC investigation which would prevent them from raising cash without disclosing a lot of details harmful to them. They won't need to raise cash this year per my math above, unless they want to do it to start financing capital infrastructure for model Y, which is not a necessity in 2018. As for the speculation of them not doing it yet, why would they? They have 2.7B in the bank and negative cash flow is reducing every day. &gt  Tesla has access to standard credit lines for about 500 million, but they recently had to pledge their Fremont factory to just maintain these credit lines.Fair point.&gt A lot of Tesla's financial executives have left the company - a red flag to many including Jim Chanos, who famously shorted Enron due to similar indicators. The head of autopilot left and the head of engineering left 'for vacation' last week.Executives have always been leaving Tesla, it comes more from the unrealistic expectations that Musk sets than from them fearing that the company will go bankrupt. Also, Jim Chanos has lost a ton of money by shorting Tesla already so why his argument is valid anymore is baffling to me. &gt Tesla's autopilot is complete false advertising. I agree they exaggerate the features, but the fact is that autopilot is statistically safer than the average driver. People have died using it, but less people die per mile in a Tesla than any other car (Tesla's are 4x safer than the average car according to statistics) &gt Their original autopilot was developed by MobilEye. MobilEye hated tesla's exaggeration of the system's capabilities and withdrew their supply after a person died using autopilot. Tesla responded that mobileye was jealous of Tesla's superior "Enhanced Autopilot" which has hardware capable of full self driving. It is universally accepted that enhanced autopilot is worse than mobileye's system right now, and in general both are basically lane-keeping system with AEB. MobilEye *used* to have a more advanced system, now it is widely accepted that EAP is at least on par with, if not better than AP1 (MobilEye's) since the updates at the beginning of the year, which leads me to my next point.&gt Waymo and GM/Cruise are far ahead with their FSD capabilities than Tesla(again, widely accepted)In terms of ability they are behind those mentioned, but no other competitor offers a system as advanced as EAP to their consumers in their car. Tesla also has several hundred times more data which is increasing every moment due to Tesla collecting data while in shadow mode on every Tesla. Those competitors have systems that work in specific cities and in specific climates and situations, but they will take a while to be rolled out to all of their cars in every market. I believe that Tesla will get FSD first, but even if I'm wrong they'll still be able to offer it at a substantially lower price since they already have the hardware necessary in every Tesla.&gt Part of Tesla's debt comes from bailing out Solar City, a completely unprofitable company loaded with debt that was run by Musk's cousins.Again, fair point but this segment of Tesla's revenues is expected to triple this year and, just like the entire company, will eventually become profitable&gt Starting from 2019 and 2020, all the major automakers are bringing out electric models. This will further damage Tesla's competitiveness, since they have the wost QA and build quality due to their haphazard and panicked development processFirst, the QA of the cars is improving every day and I haven't seen anything about any issues with any of the cars produced in the last two months. The ones with issues were from the first several thousand. Second, if there is an automaker out there that can roll out an EV and immediately start producing several thousand a week within the next year I'll be surprised. The Bolt while preceding the Model 3 by a few months had higher volume at first, now is struggling to sell (not sure if because of supply or demand) more than a few thousand a month. It's now fallen way behind the Model 3 in terms of amount delivered. 
If the WSB curse was real, then Tesla would've been bankrupt already
The fact WSB thinks Tesla will fail is the best reason I have to continue to long it. 
Bros fatally smashing their Tesla whip into brick walls? Priced in
Also the oil companies that are paying media to make him and Tesla look bad
Strangle on Tesla!?!
Is that a Tesla choker?
In 2017 tesla sold 101,000 cars.  They currently have 455,000 preorders for the model 3. They burn through money very well (flamethrower pun) but I do not believe their cash flow will decrease in the near future. Fwiw I'm not a fan of elon but I think his company will continue to run in the red and be just fine.
Elon secretly: "Please buy Tesla so I don't go broke."
Massive cost cutting by eliminating the workforce will clearly put Tesla in the green, resulting in a yuuge surge in the stock price so that Musk can sell more equity.
I honestly thought this was fake. I’m starting to think Musk is raising capital for Tesla by using the companies funds to short their own stock.
&gt transformed Jim Cramer into a Tesla BullThe most bearish signal imaginable
I think a particular reason Wall Street cares about this quarter is that Tesla is not cash flow positive and 100% of those shares go to 0 if they can't continue to borrow or further dilute sharesThe thing about "short term Wall Street" is that companies do, like, need money in the short term
&gt Tesla shares were down nearly 5 percent in after-hours trading Wednesday. After the earnings release, the stock was volatile. Initially shares moved higher before reversing. **But the decline accelerated during Tesla's earnings call when Musk's exchange with analysts grew tense after he labeled their questions "boring" and cut them off.**ELON, WHY?!?!?!RIP my calls
Tesla needs to bring Kanye on board as a head engineer and then it's straight to the moon
This means less operating expensesLess operating expenses means more profitThis is good for Tesla
If I order a Tesla right now will I even receive it before I’m dead?
Sell Pontiac. Take that money and trade FD TSLA calls until you can buy an actual Tesla. 
Bad news for Tesla = good news for TeslaGood news for MU = bad news for MUIt's simple really
Tesla loses money making Model 3. By stopping production of Model 3 they actually increase value of the company.
Good luck. Tesla is that good looking chick with STDs. Shitty financials and outrageous stock price based on hype. 
This is great DD. We need more posts like this. That being said, rationality does not work with Tesla because it's a fucking hype stock and nobody can kill it.
This is the first time I have actually hated April 1st.  You can tell it is fake though as if Tesla actually filed for bankruptcy Elon Musk would brag about refinancing while selling roadster dildos at inflated prices to his hardcore fans.
All it will take to fix this is some factory worker finding 2 cars they forgot to count. “We only missed production estimates by 98.8% instead of 98.9%” Stock to $500 by 4/20 because fuck you. Tesla operates on rainbow puppy dreams and unnatural magics.
TESLA HORSES FTW. 
Oh no, Tesla cars have become self-aware
Tesla tried to sell me a car for $80k... *80K*. Screw that just went on Craigslist and bought a 1994 Nissan Maxima for $500 cash. If all your fancy technology can't keep up with Craigslist I think the question is less about customer feedback and more about customer acquisition. 
No.  Tesla will use this money to finance a second model 3 line.  They will then announce a flying roadster that can haul 80,000 lbs in Jun of 2018, to finance building the Semi Truck. 
That's literally what he says at Tesla investor meetings.  It should be super reassuring to shareholders.
Elon created Tesla to force car companies to go electric. If Tesla falls to competition, then he considers it mission successful. He created SpaceX to force others to go back to space.His master plan is working.
Going all in. Tesla literally to the moon. 
How are you guys playing the Tesla SpaceX merger?
Now I'm certain I should short Tesla.This guy is either delusional or tactfully deceitful.
This just in. Tesla runs on fairy dust and bull shit
Elon - "we love burning cash, no one does it like tesla"Snap - " hold my beer"
Yo... what if Elon Musk created a weather machine capable of destroying Puerto Rico and is using the disaster as a way to pump Tesla Batteries to all the buildings that are going to be rebuilt?Long TSLA
Tesla donated it15 years from now Tesla ganna own Puerto Rico and open up Tesla world 
I really hope SEC investigators don't book me for making 350 off of Tesla it was my most genius move as a stockbroker
Like anyone on here can afford a Tesla anyways.
If u don't make money, u don't have to pay taxes. Tesla logic
A verbal tweet is all it takes for tesla go to up 5% so...
Fuck.  The rational side of me says this has nothing to do with Tesla, and Tesla is way over priced, and just say no.  The WSB side of me says yolo the fuck out of Tesla because retards will pump that bitch up because Elon.  Fuck.  Fuck. Fuck. 
OP is retarded.There isn't a single company better poised to dominate the green energy and automotive future than Tesla.I agree the market cap on $TSLA is absurd, but I thought the same thing about $AMZN... When I bought it at $350... And never sold. 
Just for clarity's sake. Tesla is building the world's largest factory, just for batteries. Not the world's largest battery factory but the world's largest factory by footprint.Tesla also owns the world's largest high speed charging network.Tesla also owns the world's largest vehicle support network as other manufacturers all use franchised dealerships that they don't own. Tesla owns every single one of theirs.Tesla is building grid scale energy storage and has the most in demand residential energy storage product in existence. They've just started rolling it out in Australia and builders are already offering the Powerwall as a part of a construction.Tesla, through solar city now owns the largest PV installer in the US.So these auto manufacturers comparisons are very limited.
This may sound exciting, but Tesla cannot, and will not, preform well on the moon. There are zero roads and people, so there is no domestic market for their automotive industry. Not to mention, shipping costs will be ridiculously expensive now that they have to go by rocket. 
i'm a tesla investor!! what does market cap mean
Elon musk is a known tesla shill
Elon never founded tesla. Lol
Goldman downgraded Tesla a few weeks back, then Telsa exploded to new highs. Now they downgraded everyones' favorite meme stock... Just a bunch of anal loving homos. Can't wait to fuck their wives with my fat gainz.
Tesla with two dented rims and two blown tires
Fuck you show off with your fucken Tesla
That's the market cap of Tesla...
Can't wait for my Tesla to come home with puke and used condoms all over the backseat...
